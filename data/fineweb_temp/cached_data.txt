*sigh* Fundamentalist community, let me pass on some advice to you I learned from the atheistic community:
If you have set yourself on fire, do not run.
Okay? Okay?? Please?
Look, D, you had two months to say to Harvard in private emails, "Im sorry, I shouldnt have been using that animation in my paid presentations. I wont use it again. I really do like 'Inner Life', though, and would love to use it in classroom presentations, from the BioVisions site, if that is acceptable."
I sat here, for two months, waiting for that to happen, anything to happen, and it didnt. Two months, on your own terms, you could have written a similar post to yesterdays. I would have given you the benefit of the doubt-- maybe you didnt know the credits werent visible to the audience, and I wouldnt have said a word beyond this, as its Harvards problem, not mine. This would have been a funny joke to those of us involved in dealing with you people, but it would have been a PR non-issue for you.
But after you set yourself on fire, you didnt douse it out with a bucket of ice cold reality and accountability. You ran. And youre still running.
Why not just state "I screwed up. Sorry everyone." and move on? Why the excuses? Why the denial? Why the passive language? Why the vague words and cryptic capitalizations? Why the writes and rewrites of your 'press release'? We know it wasnt written of your own volition, or it would have been done *before* Harvard had to take action. And, your behavior before this, regarding this issue, is not indicative of someone who made an innocent mistake. Its weird.
So what with this frantic running? Is the inability to say "I was wrong" a pathological feature of Creationists? Or are you hiding something? Or is it both? Or is it more?
And now we get Casey weighing in on the issue, according to cre8id at AboveTopSecret.com-- PBS/NOVA online - Intelligent Design on trial:
...to my knowledge, Discovery Institute has neither authorized nor received nor is making use of any presentation that used that animation. We have had nothing to do with creating or selling a DVD of that animation, nor do we have anything to do with placing that presentation on Google Video.I dont know what he is talking about with that last part, but the first part sounds similar to DIs claims post-Dover ("WE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH DOVER!"). Maybe Luskin is telling the truth. Maybe this was a magic non-science Creation-friendly narration with convenient edits that AiG or ICR would have killed for... but only Dembski could find it... but he cant tell us where... and he didnt share it with anyone... and its subsequently disappeared from the Internet...
But that simply isnt what Ive been told. Maybe this was all a silly Dembski mistake, blown out of proportion due to his decision to remain silent... But what if we find more videos of more DI fellows, presenting this animation?
*shrug* If youve set yourself on fire, do not run, DI. If youve done it, better admit it to Harvard now, apologize, and move on.

Free the Cans! Working Together to Reduce Waste
In a blog about how people share, it’s worth the occasional reference to the bizarre ways that people DON’T SHARE. Is it safe to say we live in a society that places great value on independence, private property, personal space, and privacy? Even sometimes extreme value? Is that why people at an 8-unit apartment building in Oakland, CA have separate caged stalls for eight separate trash cans? I know it’s not nice to stare, but I walked by these incarcerated cans and could not help myself. I returned with my camera, so that I could share my question with the world: Why can’t people share trash cans or a single dumpster? Or, at the very least, why can’t the cans share driveway space?
The Zero Waste Movement has come to the Bay Area and it calls for a new use for these eight cages. Here are my suggestions:
- Turn two of those cages into compost bins. Fill one with grass, leaves, and vegetable scraps, let it decompose for six months, then start filling the second bin in the meantime.
- Put in a green can, which is what Oakland uses to collect milk cartons, pizza boxes, yard trimmings, and all food to send it to the municipal composting facility. If your city doesn’t do this yet, tell them it’s a great idea and they could be as cool and cutting edge as Oakland.
- Put in one or two recycling cans for glass, plastic, cardboard, paper, aluminum, etc.
- Put out a FREE STUFF box for unwanted clothing and household items. The neighbors could sort through it each week, and later put it out on the curb for passers-by to explore. Take what’s left to Goodwill or a comparable donation spot.
- Put in a few small bins for various items that can be recycled, such asbatteries and electronics, which can then be taken to an electronics recycling center every month or two. Styrofoam can be brought to a local packaging store or ceramics business that accepts used packaging material. Or, if you accumulate a bunch of plastic bags,take them to a store or to some other place that accepts used ones.
- Put in ONE trash can. By the time you compost, recycle, re-use, redistribute, and take a few other measures to reduce your waste, you’ll have almost no trash each week.
- Install a bicycle rack or locked bicycle cage.
- With the leftover space, put in a container garden and a bench where neighbors can gather and chat. A much more pleasant alternative to the garbage can jailhouse ambiance, wouldn’t you agree?
ORLANDO, Fla. — While the Rapid Recall Exchange, the 2-year-old industry recall portal, has signed up more than 600 manufacturer and retailer subscribers, it still lacks the “critical mass” of suppliers that would make it a primary source of recall information, according to trade association officials and retailers.
Manufacturers use the exchange to communicate timely and accurate product recall and withdrawal notifications to retailer and wholesaler headquarters, which in turn share the information with individual stores. The exchange's retail membership represents 85% of U.S. grocery volume — including 21 of the 24 largest supermarket chains based in the United States — but it still lacks key suppliers, especially in the fresh food sectors, said Pat Walsh, senior vice president, industry relations, education and research for Food Marketing Institute, Arlington, Va.
“We have good penetration [among manufacturers] on the dry grocery side — though it needs to be better — and need to expand in other fresh food verticals like meat, produce, deli and bakery,” said Walsh, who participated in a session on the RRE at the U Connect Live conference here earlier this month.
Major food distributors in the exchange, including Kroger, Wegmans and Wakefern, have recently sent letters to their vendors explaining that the only way they will accept recall information is via the RRE, noted Brian Lynch, senior director of business and industry development for the Grocery Manufacturers Association, Washington, who also participated in the U Connect Live session. In an April letter posted on www.rapidrecallexchange.org, Kroger asked all of its suppliers to subscribe to the exchange by July 1.
Michael Roberson, director of corporate quality assurance for Publix Super Markets, Lakeland, Fla., said in the U Connect Live session that the chain is “disappointed” in the number of manufacturers using the Rapid Recall Exchange.
“Only 222 of our grocery suppliers are signed up, and more than 1,000 have not yet joined,” Roberson said. “We need to have the entire food industry collaborating on the Rapid Recall Exchange.”
Last year, of the 300 recalls Publix experienced, fewer than 50 went through the RRE, he said, adding that industrywide only 15% of recalls were submitted to the RRE. A total of 65 recalls have been issued through the exchange industrywide since its September 2009 launch.
For recalls that went through the RRE at Publix, Roberson observed “the absolute excellence in the information that was communicated,” including product GTINs (global trade identification numbers), the reason for the recall, and photos. “If we get this information from our trading partners using RRE, then we eliminate most of the [internal] steps because everything works together through this tool,” he said. By contrast, for recalls that don't go through the RRE, “nine times out of 10 we're going back to trading partners and seeking out additional information.”
Publix has been proactive in urging manufacturers to join the exchange, Roberson said. In addition, Publix has expanded its supplier scorecard to monitor and rank suppliers on whether they leverage the RRE.
The RRE was created by FMI and GS1 US, Lawrenceville, N.J., which will be issuing a new version of the exchange, 2.3, in August.

2010 Season - Bowman pulls down CCIW honor
|Matt Bowman was named CCIW "Runner of the Week" after his fourth place finish at the Brissman-Lundeen Invitational in Rock Island, Illinois on September 24.|
Augustana senior Matt Bowman (Geneva HS, Elburn, Ill.) was selected as the “Runner of the Week” in the College Conference of Illinois & Wisconsin. Bowman’s strong performance helped the Vikings finish second at the Brissman-Lundeen Invitational at Augustana College in Rock Island, Illinois on Saturday, September 24. It was an impressive second place finish for head coach Paul Olsen’s crew as they beat four nationally ranked teams.
Augustana, ranked sixth in the latest U.S. Track & Field/Cross Country Coaches Association Division III Mideast Regional poll, was one of three teams ranked in the top 10 to compete at the meet. Wisconsin-Stevens Point, ranked fifth, took the team title with 23 points. Augustana finished second with 55 points while Wisconsin-Whitewater, the seventh ranked team in regional poll, placed third with 88 points. Olivet Nazarene took fourth (138), Truman State was fifth (150) and Greenville placed sixth (263).
The field also included a couple of ranked teams in the Division III Central Regional poll. Cornell College, ranked ninth, finished tenth in the team scores with 307 points. Grinnell, the number one ranked team in the Central region, finished 16th with 415 points.
Bowman led the way for Augustana with with a fourth place finish and a time of 25:10 over the 8,000 meter course. The Vikings had ten runners run a time of 26:01 or faster. Tim Thornburg of Wisconsin-Stevens Point won the individual race with a time of 24:58 while teammates Terry Witkowski and Joel Heroux finished second and third with times of 25:00 and 25:10, respectively.
Earlier this year, Bowman finished second overall at the Western Illinois Invitational in a time of 26:11 leading the Vikings to a team victory over a field that included Western Illinois, a Division I school. The next week Bowman was the second Viking runner to cross the line at the Illinois Intercollegiate Championships. He finished in a time of 25:49, which was good for a 26th place finish in a field made up of the top college runners in the state of Illinois.
Augustana, which has only lost to two NCAA Division III schools this year –North Central at the Illinois Intercollegiate meet on September 17 and this past week to Wisconsin-Stevens Point at the Brissman-Lundeen Invitational on September 24 – will have a weekend off before they head to Waverly, Iowa to run at the Wartburg Invite on Saturday, October 9.
Bowman, the son of Gary Bowman of Geneva, Illinois and Linda Bowman of Elburn, Illinois, is an art history major.
Kraft Foods has taken the Cadbury chocolate brand in a new direction, by combining it with cheese for the first time.
The company is bringing together two of its brands and launching Philadelphia with Cadbury, a chilled chocolate spread made from Philadelphia Light and Cadbury chocolate.
Kraft believes the new product has the potential to do very well and is targeting £10m in sales in the first year.
The new cheese and chocolate spread is being launched on 1 February and will be appear in the chilled dairy aisle next to plain Philadelphia Light.
It is launching in a 160g tub and a 120g four-pack of mini tubs, both with an rsp of £1.62.
Kraft is supporting the launch with a £3.2m marketing budget in 2012 and is targeting 2,000 tonnes in volume sales – equivalent to about £10m – in the first year.
If they reached this volume of sales, the new Philadelphia with Cadbury would have the same market value as Garlic & Herb, currently the biggest-selling flavour in the Philadelphia portfolio.
Kraft already offers chocolate variants of Philadelphia in Italy and Germany, using Milka chocolate and targeting the breakfast occasion.
In Germany, Philadelphia with Milka has generated €22.2m in sales since its October 2010 launch and has a 6.6% value share of the chocolate spread market.
Kraft Foods UK marketing manager Bruce Newman said:
“The UK product would be positioned as a snack.
“The breakfast market in countries such as Germany is more developed, and our consumer research firmly identified Philadelphia with Cadbury as a snack.”

The Net Neutrality repeal vote is coming. Tell these Dems to vote Yes.
The House of Representatives is likely to vote tomorrow, Thursday, on the repeal of the FCC’s Net Neutrality power grab. Using the Congressional Review Act, the repeal of the Net Neutrality order can be accomplished in an expedited way.

Michigan unemployment claims workers are losing their jobs.
NEW YORK (CNNMoney) -- Many jobless claims workers in the state of Michigan will soon be filing for unemployment themselves.
About 400 state workers who process unemployment claims are losing their jobs thanks to Michigan's improving economy.
The state had beefed up its staff with more than 175 temporary workers in early 2009, when weekly jobless claims topped 500,000 and the unemployment rate was on its way to a 14.2% peak.
But the revival of the auto industry has turned around Michigan's fortunes -- the state's job growth outpaced the nation's in 2011. The unemployment rate has steadily declined to its current 8.6%. And jobless claims have plummeted to 187,000.
When the unemployment rate drops, so does the federal support for administering benefits. Without those funds, Michigan will have to let go of the temporary workers, as well as 225 permanent staffers, totaling about one-fifth of the Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs' staff.
"Unfortunately for them, the economy has gotten better," said Mario Morrow, spokesman for the department. "It's a good news/bad news situation."
Michigan is not the only state laying off or reassigning workers who staffed unemployment benefits call centers and processed claims. With the economy recovering, about half the nation's states are dealing with reduced federal funding, forcing them to make staffing changes.
Also, President Obama's 2009 stimulus act doled out even more money to help cover states' increased unemployment benefits caseloads. But those funds have pretty much dried up.
So even states where the jobless rates are still high are forced to make changes.
In California, which has the nation's third-highest unemployment rate at 10.7%, the state has shifted unemployment workers to disability insurance and tax processing after losing federal support.
Rhode Island, meanwhile, laid off 65 workers, most of them on temporary assignment, after running out of stimulus funds. This comes even as the state still battles a 10.9% unemployment rate, the second-highest in the nation.
The state would need $4.6 million to keep them on for another year, said Laura Hart, spokeswoman for the Department of Labor and Training.

A week ago, talk about Nebraska's running game centered on its stable of talented running backs. Now, you have to throw the quarterback into the mix as well. After redshirt freshman Taylor Martinez gashed Western Kentucky for 127 yards and three touchdowns on just seven carries last Saturday, the Huskers' ground attack became even more dangerous that it already was to begin with.
Considering NU faces an Idaho defense that gave up 148 rushing yards to I-AA North Dakota last week, Martinez and backs Roy Helu, Rex Burkhead and Dontrayevous Robinson should once again put up some big numbers on the ground this week.
NU Pass Offense vs UI Pass Defense
With Martinez getting the start once again today, it will be interesting to see if he's able to do a little more through the air against a Vandal defense that ranked 116th nationally in pass defense last season. Last week, Martinez completed some nice passes, but he also got away with some risky throws that arguably should have been picked off.
Idaho held North Dakota to just 122 passing yards and picked off two passes last week, but then again, it was against North Dakota. Nebraska's wide receivers will be some of the biggest the Vandals' secondary will face all season, and there's really no reason why the Huskers can't be a little more aggressive against such a physically inferior defensive backfield.
UI Rush Offense vs NU Rush Defense
The 155 yards and a touchdown Western Kentucky's Bobby Rainey put up against Nebraska last week were definitely reasons for concern, especially considering NU didn't give up that many yards against any of the talented backs it faced all last season. However, the players and coaches have insisted Rainey's big day was more a result of communication and alignment issues on their part and not because they were physically beaten up front.
The good news for the Husker defense is that Idaho doesn't present nearly the challenge WKU was in the run game. Sure, they rushed for nearly 150 yards and three touchdowns against UND, but the Vandals still lost four starting offensive linemen from last season, and their pass-first mentality doesn't necessarily do much for the running game either. Also, word is that sophomore Eric Martin will get the start at linebacker over Alonzo Whaley, so NU should be even more physical against the run.
UI Pass Offense vs NU Pass Defense
If there's one area where Nebraska should genuinely be concerned about going into today's game, it's how they're going to handle Idaho's explosive passing attack led by quarterback Nathan Enderle. The Huskers' secondary is considered one of the biggest strengths of the defense, but it certainly wasn't tested much at all last week.
That definitely won't be the case today, as there's no doubt that the Vandals will come out slinging the ball all over the place. Enderle and Co. passed for 399 yards and three touchdowns last week, but the passing game definitely wasn't perfect. North Dakota racked up four sacks in the first half alone and also added an interception.
Special Teams, What If's and The X-Factor
As usual, Nebraska gets the edge on special teams primarily because of senior kicker/punter Alex Henery and punt returner Niles Paul. Henery didn't really have to do much last week, and Paul came oh-so-close to breaking a couple of punt returns. In addition, kickoff specialist Adi Kunalic and kickoff returner Tim Marlowe did excellent jobs. Kunalic put two kickoffs into the end zone for touchbacks, and Marlowe averaged 34.5 yards per return. Idaho return man Justin Veltung is a threat on kick returns, but Kunalic should be able to make him a non-factor.
Nebraska Will Win If:
It continues to dominate in the run game and finds a way to put pressure on Enderle all game. Though Idaho's offensive line weighs in at an average of roughly 340 pounds, Nebraska's defensive line is much faster and more athletic, and it should be able to put some serious heat on Enderle and at least throw him off his rhythm. And if Martinez pulls off another performance like he did last week, then it's pretty much game over right there.
Idaho Will Win If:
It can force Nebraska to pass the ball and create some turnovers while also putting up some points through the air. Enderle is one of the better quarterbacks in the country right now, and if he can get enough time in the pocket to go through his reads he should be able to find some holes in NU's coverage, especially considering the inexperience at linebacker and safety.
There's no question that the one element Nebraska has that Idaho doesn't is a natural playmaker like Martinez. What he lacks in experience and his sometimes questionable decision making he more than makes up for with the ability to score every time he takes a snap. Add in Idaho's recent defensive struggles, and Martinez could be in for another highlight reel performance, which will only further separate himself from the rest of the pack as clear cut starter at quarterback.
Amazon.com (AMZN) will have a difficult time meeting analyst expectations this quarter given its several significant headwinds. The two most prominent headwinds relate to revenue, namely the imposition of state sales taxes on Amazon e-commerce revenue and the large increase in federal taxes impacting consumer demand. There is another additional key headwind that is rarely discussed in relation to Amazon, but has and will continue to have a significant impact on operating income - the price of gasoline. While it should be no surprise that gasoline impacts shipping costs, this article enables the reader to accurately predict the impact of gasoline price changes on gross margin, operating income and earnings per share.
While Amazon is quite stingy in the investment information it releases to investors (missing are tablet units, impact of sales tax, streaming users, 3P total merchandise value, AWS COGS, etc…), they do let us know their gross and net shipping expenses. Figure 1 charts gross shipping expense as a percentage of e-commerce revenue against average US gasoline prices in the quarter (regular unleaded, average of all formulations and areas). The chart illustrates that shipping expense had increased steadily from about 7.5% of revenue to 8.6% - 8.9% during 2012. This occurred while Amazon was spending billions of capital on tens of new fulfillment centers closer to the customer to reduce shipping expenses. In order to understand this divergence, I dug a little deeper to determine what is driving the much faster than revenue increases in shipping expense even as shipping distances are being reduced.
Figure 1: Amazon Gross Shipping Cost as a % of E-Commerce Revenue and Average US Gasoline Prices
Through regression analysis of Amazon and government data, I built a shipping expense growth model that demonstrates high correlation to two obvious independent variables: The price of gasoline and what Amazon refers to as "Paid Units Sold" (Amazon defines "Paid Units Sold" as "physical and digital units sold" that "are paid units and do not include units associated with certain acquisitions, rental businesses, web services or advertising businesses, or Amazon gift certificates"). The Coefficient of Determination (R2) of this regression was a convincing 0.98, displaying that these two variables alone account for the variation in shipping expense growth. As a note, I thought paid unit growth of 1P units only would be a better predictor as not all 3P units are shipped by Amazon, but the total paid units had a better R2, so I stuck with that.
What does the Statistical Analysis Tell Us?
Here is the key takeaway: Every 2% increase in gasoline price reduces Amazon's overall gross margin by 10 basis points (BPS). At $16 billion in revenue, every 10 bps of margin reduction results in a $16 million reduction in operating income, or about 2.5¢ in earnings per share reduction. While 10 bps may not sound like a lot, 2.5¢ represents 28% of the analysts $0.09 consensus estimate for Q1. So a minor 2% shift up in gasoline costs can shift earnings lower by 28% in Q1.
Let's look at this in the wider context of future earnings potential. Amazon bulls like to point to 2009 Q4 as a shining example of Amazon profit potential as they achieved 4.0% net margin and $0.85 per share of earnings. They claim that once all of the current investments subside, Amazon will either return to or exceed those peak margin levels on much higher revenue. Here is a dose of reality for the bulls: If gasoline prices per gallon in 2009 Q4 were what it is today, Amazon would have earned a measly $0.02 per share instead of $0.85! That means given today's energy environment Amazon faces nearly 4.0% net margin headwinds from its prior peak performance.
Has The Fulfillment Center Build Out Strategy Had Any Positive Impact At All?
There is one other interesting result of the analysis to note: the model generated an additive constant term of negative 8.8%. That means that with zero unit growth and no gasoline price change, Amazon shipping expense would shrink by 8.8% Y/Y. This is the positive impact of the distributed fulfillment center strategy and is already baked into the current numbers - you just can't see it in Amazon's financial results due to higher gasoline prices and much higher unit shipments than revenue growth over the past four years. The end result is that although Amazon management recognized they need to do something to stem these two major headwinds, they have only lost ground. While they have increased fulfillment expense as a percentage of revenue by 270 bps, shipping expense has increased 120 bps as a percentage of revenue, thus reducing net margin by 400 bps over the past four years. Based on these trends it seems Amazon will need to continue to invest heavily in fulfillment expenses over the next several years just to return to 2009 shipping expense percentage levels of e-commerce revenue.
Is There Hope For Gasoline Prices to Return to 2009 Levels?
This is highly unlikely as the global financial crisis scared the energy markets into a severe dip (60% drop) at the end of 2008/early 2009. Gasoline prices have begun an exponential run up over the past few weeks and have well surpassed both the prior quarter and year ago quarter's level seven weeks into the quarter (Figure 2). Oil prices tend to lead gasoline prices by 4 to 6 weeks, so look for gasoline prices to continue to rise significantly into the end of Q1 to near all-time high levels ($4.11/gal) as oil continues to print new 9-month highs. That could mean all time high shipping expense as a percentage of e-commerce revenue for Amazon in Q2. The current White House Administration's tough policy approach on fossil fuels coupled with the Fed's QE infinity program should continue to pressure oil prices higher through at least 2015, leading me to wonder why Amazon is considered a "risk-on" trade with its strong inverse earnings sensitivity to oil prices. Not only does an increase in gasoline cost increase Amazon's shipping expense, it also lowers consumer's discretionary income, thus providing an additional headwind to revenue - a true double whammy.
Figure 2: Weekly US Gasoline Prices for Q/Q and Y/Y Comparisons
Core to Amazon's value proposition is the convenience of shipping product directly to your door. That service currently reduces operating margin by 870 bps (up from 750 bps three years ago) and is directly correlated to the cost of gasoline. For every 2% increase in gasoline cost, Amazon gross margin declines by 10 bps. This relation has reduced Amazon net margin by 400 bps to zero over the last four years. While spending billions on new distributed fulfillment centers has attempted to reduce the impact of soaring gasoline prices, shipping expenses as a percentage of e-commerce revenue continues to climb as Amazon paid units shipped far outpace revenue growth and gasoline price increases continue to override any Amazon efficiency gains. In the current money printing and political environment, energy costs are skyrocketing, thus having a direct and meaningful impact on Amazon profit potential for 2013 and beyond.

Tips for Preventing Medicare Fraud
The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of the Inspector General (OIG) has created a new web site to provide tips for preventing Medicare fraud and medical identity theft. See HHS news release.
OIG’s new web site includes a brochure containing tips, where to report fraud, and other resources. In addition, CMS issued a Medicare Fraud & Abuse Fact Sheet earlier this year.
Polish-born Chicago boxer Andrew Golota will plead not guilty at a court date July 19 to charges of unlawful possession of 12 guns, his lawyer said Friday. "There are two sides to every story, and we look forward to a full exploration of the most recent allegations against Andrew," Matthew P. Walsh II said. Golota, 38, was released from police custody Thursday evening after being charged with the misdemeanor counts of possess-ing unregistered firearms. His owner's ID card to possess them had been revoked, according to police, who came to Golota's Northwest Side home Wednesday after two women had left there and called 911. No charges have been filed related to other allegations brought by the women.
I’ve a new release of NYTProf ready to upload but I’m stuck.
The CPAN Testers service is reporting a failure on a number of systems but I can’t reproduce it locally or work out the cause.
Can you reproduce the failure with Devel::NYTProf 2.07_94? If so, could you give me remote access via ssh? (Or spare some time to investigate yourself – I’ll happily clue you in if you can reproduce the problem.)
Update: No one could reproduce it. It seems that the failures was not what it appeared to be. A clue was that only one tester was affected. Devel-NYTProf-2.07_94.tar.gz unpacked itself into a directory called Devel-NYTProf-2.07. It seems that when using CPANPLUS if the user had already got an old Devel-NYTProf-2.07 directory its contents got merged and tests would fail. I’m not convinced that’s the whole story, but Devel-NYTProf-2.07_95.tar.gz unpacked into a Devel-NYTProf-2.07_95 directory and didn’t run into the problem.
Update: More usefully, Andreas made my wish come true by pointing out the –solve parameter to the ctgetreports utility in his CPAN::Testers::ParseReports distribution. It “tries to identify the best contenders for a blame using Statistics::Regression. [...] The function prints the [...] top 3 candidates according to R^2 with their regression analysis.” Cool.

Urban School Food Alliance Shows Solidarity by Serving the Same Menu to 2.9 Million Students
LOS ANGELES, March 20, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- In a show of solidarity in providing healthy meals to U.S. students, the Urban School Food Alliance (USFA), which consists of some of the largest school districts in the country, will be serving the same lunch menu to its more than 2.9 million students today. The six school districts, New York City Department of Education, Los Angeles Unified School District, Chicago Public Schools, Dallas Independent School District, Miami-Dade County Public Schools and Orange County Public Schools in Orlando, officially formed USFA earlier this year to use their purchasing power to continue to improve food quality for students while driving down costs.
"This show of solidarity is unprecedented," said Los Angeles Unified School District Food Services Director David Binkle. "It demonstrates that all the school districts in the alliance can work together to implement the same programs while serving nutritious meals to our students."
The lunch meal, consisting of savory roasted chicken, brown rice with seasoned black or red beans, steamed green broccoli, fresh seasonal fruit and milk, will be served more than 2.6 million times today in the six districts.
"We created this menu based on the most popular items we commonly serve in each of our Districts," said Leslie Fowler, Director of Nutrition Support Services at Chicago Public Schools. "Our goal moving forward is to identify these commonalities and work with our vendors to capitalize on our purchasing power so that we're providing the best and freshest foods possible to our students at the lowest costs possible."
The Urban School Food Alliance first met in Denver in 2012 and has since kept in communication regularly via telephone. The food services directors from each of the school districts share and review menu items to ensure that they provide access to meals that meet the USDA's nutrient recommendations including whole grain products, low fat dairy, fresh produce and lean protein that when prepared are calorie conscious and low in fat, sugar and sodium. In addition to creating a purchasing powerhouse, the coalition is working to be more ecologically friendly in their respective districts. As a whole, the alliance procures more than $530 million in food and food supplies annually.
In recent years, the school districts in the alliance have implemented innovative ways to provide access to school meals including expanded options for reaching more students with breakfast on campus as well as supper after school in order to meet the needs of students.

Oklahoma Deer Hunters Hit Record Harvest
Oklahoma deer hunters have already achieved a record harvest for the state in 2006 — 104,000 and counting — but their opportunities to take deer are far from being over. The state's special antlerless deer season is just around the corner. Scheduled for Dec. 22-24 and Dec. 29-31, these opportunities allow hunters to harvest does outside their combined season limit.
According to Mike Shaw, wildlife research supervisor for the Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation, hunters across the state have already harvested 104,346 deer in 2006, surpassing the previous record of 102,100 deer taken in 2000. That total stands to increase with the remainder of archery and special antlerless seasons still to go. Shaw said other factors will raise the numbers as well, such as final counts from controlled hunts and Deer Management Assistance Program cooperators.
Shaw said a number of circumstances have led to the record harvest, such as the good hunting weather and peak rutting times that fell right in line with this year's rifle season.
But even with the record numbers, Shaw encourages hunters to participate in the special three-day antlerless hunts.
"We need to really focus on increasing the number of antlerless deer harvested, especially in areas that have less desirable buck-to-doe ratios," Shaw said. "And participating in the special antlerless deer season would be an excellent way to do that."
The first three-day period of the special antlerless season will be limited to the northcentral and northwestern portions of the state, excluding most of the panhandle. The second three-day period will be open for hunting in the same areas as the first part of the season, but also in most of the remainder of the state. The panhandle will again be excluded, as will the far southeastern counties. For a map of Oklahoma's antlerless deer hunt zones and to see which counties will be open for the special season, hunters should refer to page 14 of the "2006-07 Oklahoma Hunting Guide."
To participate in the special antlerless deer season, hunters must possess a special antlerless deer gun license as well as an annual hunting license and a fishing and hunting legacy permit. Resident lifetime hunting or combination license holders are exempt from purchasing these licenses.
In addition, hunters participating in the special antlerless deer season must comply with the hunter orange requirements set forth for the regular deer gun season. Archery hunters and those hunting most other species in open special antlerless zones must wear either a hunter orange hat or upper garment while hunting.
To learn more about this year's special antlerless deer season, refer to the "2006-07 Oklahoma Hunting Guide" or log on to www.wildlifedepartment.com.

- Former Nickelodeon star Amanda Bynes arrested for drug possession in New York
- Amanda Bynes' parents are trying to get her placed under a conservatorship
- One Direction won four awards at the inaugural Social Star Awards
- ‘Zero Dark Thirty’ star Jessica Chastain found it ‘scary’ wearing Elizabeth Taylor's necklace
- Bradley Cooper is ‘grateful for’ 'The Hangover' franchise
Father-of-five Charlie told the officer, "No parent should have to watch their kid go through that", and the next day sent a cheque for $75,000 to the Hermosa Beach Police Association, which had started a fund in Jasmine's honour.
According to website TMZ.com, Charlie's stunt-double Eddie Braun also gave $25,000, and the the family is extremely grateful for the donation and hopes their actions will inspire others to join the fight against CR.
CR is a debilitating form of cancer that occurs in the muscle tissue and requires over a year of expensive medical treatments like chemotherapy and radiation therapy.
Last month, Charlie gave Lindsay Lohan $100,000 when he heard she was having financial difficulties, but claimed she had never thanked him.
He said: "She got shorted and I found out, so I said, 'Here.'
"I'm still waiting for a text to say, 'Thank you'. Anything you know?"

While it can be difficult for aging adults to get their unique exercise needs met, programs like SilverSneakers are helping older adults take better control of their health. Dr. Oz talks with Steve Lindstrom, senior vice president of Healthway's SilverSneakers Fitness Program, about the nation's leading exercise program designed exclusively for older adults.
Founded in 1992, and available at no additional cost to individuals who belong to participating Medicare health plans, SilverSneakers offers a blend of physical activity, healthy lifestyle information and socially oriented programming for older Americans. The program offers eligible member access to fitness centers, classes, health education seminars and other events that are specially designed for seniors.
According to Steve, SilverSneakers saves insurance companies money while promoting wellness among their customers and has paved the way for other healthcare providers to institute similar plans. Steve says older Americans who are interested in joining a fitness program but do not belong to participating Medicare health plans, should consult their own health insurer, which will now likely offer something similar.

Exhibition will provide a meeting place for businesses interested in capitalizing on India's waste management and recycling markets.
Waste Management and Recycling India will be held from 8-10 April 2013 at India Expo Centre and Mart, Greater Noida Expressway, Delhi, India.
The conference is being organized by Inter Ads-Brooks Exhibitions of India in partnership with Mack Brooks Exhibitions Ltd. of the U.K.
The event is planned to provide a meeting place in India for businesses, products and services engaged in the waste and recycling industry, to connect the businesses involved in this sector and to assist professionals in discovering more about doing business in a country with one of the fastest growing economies, reports Michelle Amer, a spokesperson with Mack Brooks Exhibitions.
According to information posted on the conference website, India’s population produces some 68.8 million tons of municipal solid waste per year, a level of 188,500 tons per day. If the current growth trend continues, the organization has estimated, urban India will generate 160.5 million tons by 2041, and over the next decade some 920 million tonnes of solid waste will need to be properly managed.
Amer observes that with its current population of 1.2 billion people and a rapidly developing infrastructure, there are many opportunities in India for businesses in the recycling, waste management and energy from waste sectors. Amer also reports that by 2050, Indian economic output could be equivalent to that of the United States.
A number of U.S., European and U.K. companies are already working in India to take advantage of its waste infrastructure growth, Amer says.

NEWTOWN -- Sandy Hook Elementary School students and staff will return to classes after the holiday break at a new location that one school board member described as "filled with love.''
The other six Newtown schools will reopen for instruction on Jan. 2. Sandy Hook faculty will report that day to their new location at Chalk Hill School in Monroe to meet and reorganize, followed by an afternoon open house at which teachers, students and parents can reunite.
Chalk Hill has been made over to replicate Sandy Hook Elementary as it was before the shooting of Dec. 14, when 20 students and six educators at the school were killed, including Principal Dawn Hochsprung.
"In one room I visited (at Chalk Hill School), the children's pens and pencils are on the desks, their coats behind their chairs,'' said board member John Vouros, a retired Newtown teacher. "It's as if time stood still.''
Schools Superintendent Janet Robinson announced last week that based on teachers' requests, she opted for a soft opening at Chalk Hill on the first day after the holiday break, with instruction to resume on Jan. 3.
Robinson agreed that teachers need time alone to reassemble as a staff. They will be lead by former Principal Donna Page on a temporary basis. The teachers also wanted time to greet and assure children and parents that they are safe as school begins anew.
On Wednesday, Robinson said some Sandy Hook families have already walked through Chalk Hill School, and that has provided some "comfort'' that the school will be ready for instruction and be safe. Extra security will be on duty, Robinson said.
The timing of the shooting, just before the holiday break, left teachers without time to do much more than attend funerals for their students and staff, Robinson said.
"It's been overwhelming,'' she said. "They need a chance to be together and organize themselves.''
Once staff and students are back to their routine academic schedule, Robinson said, the healing can truly begin.
"Children are amazingly resilient, more than we are as adults,'' she said.
Robinson said she said she is proud of all the "heroes'' in her district who did that horrid Friday what they pledge to do every day -- take care of their students.
"The talk of heroism, this is not mythology,'' Robinson said. "They were doing what teachers would do to protect their children.''
In time, Robinson said, she hopes the school will erect a mural or a quilt of some kind as a memorial.
As for Sandy Hook Elementary School's future, Robinson said she expects a community conversation on that topic to begin shortly.
"That will be a town decision,'' she said.
Hockey fans cheer on Team Canada during their game against Team Denmark during World Juniors hockey action at Rexall Place in Edmonton Alberta, Thursday Dec. 29, 2011.
Credits: DAVID BLOOM/EDMONTON SUN/QMI AGENCY
EDMONTON -- In a game that had moths versus windshield written all over it, there wasn't enough wiper fluid in all of Edmonton to clean off the goo.
But despite all the guts, there wasn't much glory to be found for Team Canada in crushing hopelessly overmatched Denmark 10-2 at the world junior championship Thursday.
This was lambs being lead to slaughter and the Canadians simply went about their business with the cold and ruthless efficiency of an executioner.
"It's a hard game to play in when you're expected to win and expected to score a lot of goals," said head coach Don Hay. "It's not easy to do. But we got through the game with no injuries and we got the win."
They had the win after the first period, in which they outshot Denmark 19-3 and built a 4-0 lead, but there were, unfortunately, two more periods to play, which can best be described as a half-interested cat pawing at a half-dead mouse.
"Maybe not our toughest competition," understated Ryan Strome. "But we have to continually strive to be better. None of the games are getting easier from here on in so we have to keep getting better ourselves."
They'd have to play corpses for the next game to be any easier, but all you can do is play who they put in front of you and the Canadians are 3-0 so far, having beaten Finland 8-1 and the Czech Republic 5-0 for a 23-2 margin of victory so far.
Three straight blowouts might not be the best way to prepare for the biggest games of their lives, but what can you do?
"People can look at it however they want, but we've been tested," said Brett Connolly. "The Finns were a great team, the Czechs gave us a good battle, too. We're a good team."
After scoring more goals in the first (four) than Denmark had shots (three), Canada eased up in the second but still managed to score its fifth, sixth and seventh goals of the night.
And that was it, the other team was Dane like dinner.
"It was a tough one for Denmark, coming up from the B pool," said winger Boone Jenner. "But we just tried to keep playing our game, just play simple hockey."
"It's not like we were trying to run up the score," added forward Brendan Gallagher. "We've been on the other side of those, all of us have, and it's not a good feeling."
The Canadians spent the third period trying not to get injured and that was all the opening Denmark needed to strike back. Nicolai Meyer sniped one past Mark Visentin to break the shutout and eight minutes later Emil Kristensen added a second Danish goal.
At that point, Canada got serious again and scored its eighth and ninth and 10th.
"We knew on the bench that we had to get back to work," said Gallagher. "We were a little sluggish and they took advantage of us. They didn't stop working for the whole game. We just went back to the things that made us successful and were able to score some more goals."
So the Canadians are 3-0 so far, with one game left in the round robin -- a New Year's Eve date with the Americans that could either be for first place in the pool, or rendered entirely meaningless if the U.S. loses to the Czech Republic on Friday.
"We'll be ready to roll on New Year's Eve," said Jenner. "It should be a fun game to play in, and a competitive one."
For a change.

It’s Time to Panic — The Great Chicken Wing Shortage May Wreak Havoc with Your Super Bowl Plans
Okay, America. We have some news that will profoundly affect how you watch the Super Bowl. Brace yourself.
No, scientists still haven’t figured out a way to teleport you there under the cloak of invisibility, so you still need a ticket.
It turns out a shortage of chicken wings may be on the horizon
What the cluck is that about? That’s like playing a Super Bowl without a football.
Before you go loco, keep in mind the very fake-sounding, but very much real National Chicken Council chimed in to explain the reason behind this biggest national disaster not involving the name Manti Te’o. And while the economics behind it are more convoluted than the 49ers defensive scheme, it comes down to this:
“Demand for wings this year is at ‘an all-time high’ due to decreased wing production caused by the high cost of corn and feed prices. Wings are currently the highest priced portion of a chicken and cost $2.11 a pound in the Northeast, up 12 percent from last year.”
The council says 1.23 billion wing segments – they don’t sound as tasty when called “segments” do they? — will be wolfed down during this year’s big game, about 12.3 fewer than we gobbled up last year when the New York Giants managed to wipe the smirk off Bill Belichick’s face.
Short of Beyoncé deciding to lip sync (again!) during halftime, this may be the most scandalous thing to hit this year’s game. The Super Bowl is the second biggest day for food during the year, trailing only Thanksgiving, and wings are the most consumed item on this most sacred of Sundays.
A spokesman for the National Chicken Council did manage to alleviate everyone’s worst fear, though, by saying wings will be available. He added that although they may cost a bit more, “The good news for consumers is that restaurants plan well in advance to ensure they have plenty of wings for the big game.” Phew. Bullet dodged.
Good to know because without wings, we’d be left only to eat pizza. And sliders. And Doritos. And M&Ms. And pigs in a blanket. And fried chicken. And subs. And pretzels.
And heaven knows that’s just not enough selection for all the artery-clogged football fans out there.

Mrs. Plager told her boys not to grow up to be cowboys.
So they didn't.
Over at CIO the debate rages about whether or not Brian Leetch is an answer for our D corps.
I said no but regular commentator Steve asked, well, who then?
Uh ... good question.
Regular surfers here know I'm a pint half full type of guy or as Lowetide would say I tend to Blue sky things.
I'll admit to that.
And while I can paint a scenario where the Oilers can make do with their D as presently constituted just as I painted a scenario where the Oilers could get by the Wings, the truth is this team has three decent guys who can eat up minutes (Smith, Staios, Tarnqvist) and a bunch of question marks. Bergeron might figure it out. Hejda may be a player. One of Smid, Gilbert, Syvret or Young may be ready. Greene may be ready to be Commodore (although I think he is a year or two away from that in reality). Check out San Jose's D if you want to see young and unproven. They did alright.
The truth is the Oil likely will get a decent third pair out of the lot of them this season and in a year or two we will have a nice quality young D corps.
So where do we look?
A really nice summary of teams and their cap situations here and a few things jumped out at me.
The Oilers have gone back to being young - the third youngest team after San Jose and Columbus from what I can see. Of course this includes Schremp on the roster.
Jersey, even with the rumours that they are going to try and hide Mogilny and Malakhov on the IR to resolve their salary situation, are still in big cap trouble. Problem is the guy I like, Rafalski, has an expensive number on his contract and I'm not sure if Matvichuk or Lukowich add much more then what we have.
So, why the Plager brothers up above? Because while the Blues may have, in some estimations (Lowetide again and Mudcrutch as well) have had a nice summer, I think they aren't even close to being back. And they have a lot of age up front - Weight, Guerin, Tkachuk and Drake. Only Detroit, Jersey and Dallas are older.
And they have three young Dmen - Brewer, Backman and Jackman.
Could we pry either of the latter two away for a young forward or two? Would Torres fit the bill? Or someone else?
Maybe a fit?

Here is the essay based on the observance of the recurrence and cost of wars during my lifetime.
How fine might this world have been and how great might it have become, but for the upheaval of cataclysmic war? How much more civilized and humane, how caring and decent, how trusting in love and oriented with virtue? For, of one thing yet may we be assured, that the world can only be poorer today by the lacking, deficient today by the omission of the contributions and hopes of those deceased or disabled by the dreadful decimation of wars which have taken so many of the talented and the brave from out our midst, from off the broken breadth of this peculiar, polluted planet, from space so yet beautiful a distant blue, this our world, our war-torn, weeping world, carbureted under the hungry skies of this so much Hamburger Heaven Earth that so well knows the nature and the ubiquitous loss of un-godly war.
Still, so ever most graciously abetted by blood, it is surely a better world ensconce we here today--for the life, and well-being sacrificed of these ever so valiantly brave, as did they ever so gallantly behave in the preserving of good, in the thwarting of evil--then might else have been attained for this our home of estuaries humane as course the banks and bridges, branches and arms, floes and coves and inlets in and about the lands and seas of the free, of we the peoples yet ardent and free who tread firmly today in both safety and in peace over the clear, cool paths and porticos of freedom with un-leaned-on a deed-- our soldiers having thus secured and sealed these byways in the sacrificial medium of their very human lives.
May we give thanks to God on this, and on all days, for these military women and men, our warriors, our air-men and sea-men, present, past and future who make, have made, and will make clear and safe the thoroughfares of freedom. Thank you, Soldiers, for the most decent, shining and princely of ardencies and for the utterly altruistic magnanimity of your supremely chivalrous sacrifices. "No greater love has a man than this..." And you much more deserve than these, our little medallions and fillets, our bands and cinctures and carcanets, these little stars and hearts and crosses, these shreds of purple and ribbons of blue, cinches and braids of honorary hue bestowed of dignitaries, generals, governors, and presidents -- although prestigiously fitting, these small signs, so quite impelling to discern upon the chests of You, our true heroes-- yet matching not the level of our indebtedness and gratitude to you.

It has been noticed on several occasions that
DayOfWeek function is rather slow when applied to a large list of dates, e.g. in this recent question. What faster alternatives do we have in such situations?
Just a literal implementation of a formula for the day of the week:
Seems to give a 5-fold speed increase:
Your function is readily compilable:
I will provide one solution which will be using Java and a simple Java reloader I recently introduced. This solution brings to the table up to 100-fold speed-up for large lists of dates.
I will borrow @Mike's functions to generate a random list of dates, from his code in his recent question
The input is a nested list of the type we construct randomly, which is a natural date format as it appears in Mathematica. I subtract 1 from month, to comply with the Java conventions.
Use and benchmarks
There is a 100-fold speedup for this example. Note that there is a small constant overhead of calling Java, so the larger is your list of dates, the more you gain.
I think that this can be one of the "canonical" examples of a situation where the use of Java is more than appropriate. Generally, this happens when some of the following is true:
Effective use of Java / JLink implies that loops are outsourced to Java. Only then the overhead of Java / JLink will not play a big role. Performing looping in Mathematica while invoking Java functions is likely to not be faster, and often be slower, than doing it all in Mathematica.
A big thanks goes to @Mike for spotting a bug in the reloader (which has been now fixed).
This assumes the use of the Gregorian system, so this will require some modification if you need to work with dates older than the switching date September 14, 1752 (where the Julian system was still in use).
Here's how to adapt
This recent post reminded me that
~ 41X speed-up.
Super-fast. You need the Joda Time library for that.
If you're a hardcore JLink user, you have the first two lines in your init.m anyway, so the problem reduces to 71 characters, with an amazing speed.
Joda Time is ISO 8601-compliant.
I will provide one solution which will be using ANSI C and LibraryLink. Needless to say that this is a speeder...(Platform: MacOSX, gcc 4.2)
The preparations are the same as in Leonid's answer.
Create the Library and load it
Microsoft's compiler (CL) has similar options with just different naming...
The dayOfWeek function
As the argumentation holds to use Java, because of it's simple interface I think I've shown that this holds as well for C/C++ and is unbeatable fast.

When ‘carpe diem’ is the wrong motto
Posted June 4, 2010on:
Carpe diem – sieze the day. Sounds cool and all if you are a grunt….maybe.
Today, carpe diem – seize the day – was NOT a cool thing for me.
I had a seizure today…at the park…after having brunch with some girl friends and my mommy and her girl friends.
Don’t ask me what happened. Don’t ask the doctors either. They don’t know.
The good news is that the seizure didn’t affect my brain. It got my daddy’s brain instead mommy said. I am not sure if that is funny or not.
Turns out that every now and then a by Russ (Editor: virus) will make a fever happen and that the fever will make little people shake and shimmy enough to scare the water out of mommies and daddies and friends and preachers and church folk and and…enough to get people to pray. (That’s not a bad thing I hear.)
I am getting better now and the frog knows sis (Ed: prognosis) is that it shouldn’t happen again.
I can live with that…or without it as the case may be.
Thank God I am okay. But I think mommy is still worried about daddy’s brain.
Nice, but they’re still white, conventionally attractive, not visually trans* or disabled, neither of them have visable scarring, stretchmarks, etc, I mean, even on a basic body-positive note, neither of them have hair legs or armpits.
I’ve yet to see ONE graphic along these lines that actually include anything other than the chubby/skinny thing. Let’s see some fat, scarred and stretchmarked black trans women with prosthetic limbs or dwarfism or something, and hairy legs, maybe she’s got a shaped afro or something, natural black hair is looked down on by society.
Then I’ll get as excited as the rest of tumblr by these nicely drawn graphics.
YOU PEOPLE ARE NEVER HAPPY A RE YOU
IS THIS FUCKING BETTER??!?@»@?
Geotags, aerial synths, street synths… capturing events as they happen. If you can mark it on a map, then this is the place to talk about it.
There are some really cool places in the world that I'd love to see synths of, but for lack of time and money haven't been able to make it to (yet). Here's my list. What about other people, what would you like to see?
• Shiptons Arch, China
• Angel Falls, Venezuela
• Nazca lines, Peru
• Bungle Bungles, Australia
• some bones in dinosaur national monument, Colorado/Utah
• Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe/Zambia
• K2/Baltoro Glacier, Pakistan http://maps.live.com/default.aspx?v=2&FORM=LMLTCP&cp=35.759607~76.548615&style=h&lvl=11&tilt=-90&dir=0&alt=-1000&cam=-54.055532~-37.330167&scene=-1&phx=0&phy=0&phscl=1&encType=1
• Deer Cave, Malaysia
The Ice Hotel!
[Insert large cavern system here] preferably shot both as a walk-through (and back!) but also as panoramics in areas of interest so we get lots of donuts.
Another one high on my list would be an aerial synth of the Grand Canyon, preferably done about 200' below the altitude of the rim so you're down in it the whole way. Ideally, photograph it using a hemispherical array of cameras all synchronized to a single shutter control so you get instant donuts every time an exposure is taken.
But you know what would be tops on my list? For the Mars rover teams to submit their pictures as massive synths. MWAHAHAHAHAHAA! I'd love to boldly go where no man has gone before. Ok, so little wheeled robots have, but...
I realize I'm posting things that aren't likely to be picked up by someone local to the place who says, "Sure! That's easy enough!" but these really are the places I'd love to see synthed.
How about New Zealand. Not exciting? I'm talking about someone Synth'ing their Bungie trip from the walk up, to the jump off, the way down, and the bounce back up.
That camera had better be strapped onto their helmet...
Fracture - this thread was meant to be list of all the places in the world we'd like to see a synth of where we currently don't have one. We actually have OK coverage of NZ, but havent seen any taken while bungie jumping. That would be fairly cool, skydiving as well.
Can you guys think of any more places/situtation we need synths of?
Son Doong Cave In Vietnam
While I was replying to a thread about collaborative synths, this came to mind:
I know Photosynth won't synth water, but a closer statement would be that it won't synth the water's surface. Underwater there are loads of fixed points to tie images together. Soooo...
I'd love to see a synth of a coral reef. That would be a BLAST.
Even better, I'd love to figure out a way to tie the below-water images to the above-water shots and have someone on the reef and someone else on shore doing a collaborative synth. You'd be able to "stand on the beach" at the beginning of the synth, and "dive underwater" to see the reef.
(Oh PLEEEEZE tell me someone is interested in doing this! I don't have an underwater housing on my camera!!)
I think Tom's onto something here. I think the transition from above water to below water would be the absolute hardest part, but I too would LOVE to see this.
A good polarizer and a really careful choice of angles might work. I've had underwater features show up in a couple of synths I've done this way. It might be enough to tie the two, though the other direction would be a LOT harder.
(Anyone on the Big Island with an underwater housing for their camera? I'll do the dry-land photography!)
Cave systems in halong bay/Cat Ba island Vietnam would fit your suggestion TBenedict, and I'd love to see them
http://images.google.com/images?q=halong bay cave system&rls=com.microsoft:en-gb:IE-SearchBox&oe=UTF-8&sourceid=ie7&rlz=1I7HPEA_en&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&hl=en&tab=wi
Also synths of reefs.. excellent idea. There are a huge team of underwater photographers in Egypt and some awesome dive sites I'm sure the Devs here could fire off some emails to camel divers & they could use it for promo work ;) ;) One possiblility would be the use of a glass bottom boat to ease the transition from land to water?
I'd particularly like to see some underwater wrecks, starting underwater at the boat near a shallow reef and descending down. Some well phrased emails would definately start off a few clusters of this type of synth!
Any series of photos from space... The saturn mission has some good stuff going around Titan - their pictures are already in the public domain as well, I reckon they might be up for some synthing..
I honestly think you're right, the above/below beach/reef synth should ideally be done by underwater photographers.
I REALLY like the idea of the glass bottomed boat for the transition. That or something similar on a smaller scale.
I'm still interested in doing this, but I hope an honest to goodness underwater photographer beats me to it. It will be far better done.
Your mention of space synths (of which I think NASA has done several) gave me an idea... I'll try to get this one done later in the week (time permitting.)
Okay, I'm now obsessed with large scale underwater reef synthing... Underwater photography is tough, normally holiday divers don't have the equipment to balance the red shift (deeper water has less blue light) it's a pain to have to add/remove coloured slides for every photo.. (sorry--going off topic there)
I emailed one dive centre in Sharm el Sheik but they haven't responded so I have sent emails out to dive centres I have worked at in the past suggesting they make a synth map a part of their dive master/master scuba diver course or make a synth to use for promos, there are centres where professionals dive the same reefs month in month out, 20 photos per dive, 70 dives per month... Anyways, I'll let you know if I get any success synth fishing :D
Also, to return to the thread topic - I'd love to see a synth from the front of a train, some rapid fire photos might do the trick from trains both ways?
*deeper water has less red light... doh!
Glad to see you taking point on this, Mister_Blondie! I don't even qualify as a holiday diver, and my equipment is nil. I really like the direction you're taking with that, especially the idea of using photos from centers where professionals are in there all the time. I'd really like to see how that turns out!
I don't know about the front of a train, but a while back Darius posted a link to a "drive through" synth where someone was taking pictures from inside a car, coming and going. The technique works quite well. At the speeds most trains go, though, you might need a pretty high frame rate to pull that off. Glad you thought of doing it both ways. For the viewer to be able to turn around and go back, that's essential.
No dice on the space synth I hoped to do this week. I'll have another chance next week, so I'll give it another go then.
A sculpture park. A whole big sculpture park...
Here's an fantastic attempt at a sculpture park: http://photosynth.net/view.aspx?cid=97153326-97b4-4df7-ba8d-aaf9851fa34d
This is pushing the upper limit of the synther as it is, so a park larger than this would be very difficult. The overhead view in this one is great.
awesome, thanks :)
I'd like to see some Mt Everest base camp synths.
This takes a step out of the realm of the real world, but I'd absolutely love to see Michael Chesko's miniature model cities thoroughly synthed.
He's worked on models of New York City, but also has a fictional city of his own design, entitled 'Britannica'. I happened to bump into his work on Robyn Miller's blog some time ago and have been hooked on the idea of synthing his models ever since.
You can find one of Robyn's Britannica posts here: http://tinselman.typepad.com/tinselman/2008/08/stop-and-smell.html
Unfreakin'real. I second that, Nathanael. I'd be willing to be there are no small number of photographers who would be ready to jump at the chance. (I WOULD!)
I would love to synth Jack Lewis's house, "The Kilns".
Short of being able to tackle it myself, though, I'd truly enjoy someone else doing a good job of it.

DALLAS, Nov. 23, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Southridge Enterprises Inc.

Due to the change in legal representation, the Company will be filing its 2012 annual report in the coming week. Southridge will report its fourth quarter and annual results ending August 31, 2012, reflecting record mineral production, revenues and profits as per the Company's new release of September 04, 2012.
In other recent developments, the Company has now distributed funds and completed its dividend payout one day early on November 21, 2012, in lieu of the payout date falling on Thanksgiving Day, for shareholders of record on November 15, 2012. The Company expects to continue its dividend payouts on a quarterly basis.
Additionally, the Company will be releasing some positive news, developments and events concerning one of its mineral properties located in a world-class mining region of Mexico. Southridge anticipates releasing this news on or before November 27th, 2012.
Southridge Minerals currently holds a portfolio of mineral properties located in several world-class mining regions of Mexico. The properties include the past producing and flagship property Cinco Minas , along with the Gran Cabrera, Los Compadres, La Esperanza, La Canita and El Horconcito.
With metal prices forecasted to remain buoyant, properties that offer significant potential for Gold and Silver occurrence, a diverse management team, and a strong cash position, Southridge Minerals is well positioned to develop its opportunities and build shareholder value.

Was The Race To The Moon Real?; June 1994; Scientific American Magazine; by Logsdon, Dupas; 8 Page(s)
Twenty-five years ago, on July 20, 1969, Neil A. Armstrong took the first footsteps on the surface of the moon. That event marked a political and technological victory for the U.S. in its cold war rivalry with the U.S.S.R. In the years that followed, the Soviet government insisted that the Soviet Union had never planned a lunar landing. Hence, it argued, the contest to send humans to the moon was a onesided exercise. The reality is otherwise; recently declassified information from that era and testimony of key participants in the Soviet space program under Khrushchev and Brezhnev prove that the moon race was indeed real.
New evidence reveals that personal rivalries, shifting political alliances and bureaucratic inefficiencies bred failure and delays within the Soviet lunar-landing program. In contrast, the American effort received consistently strong political and public support. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration and its contractor teams also benefited from a pool of skilled and highly motivated workers and managers. Despite an early Soviet lead in human space exploration, these factors, along with more generous and effective allocation of resources, enabled the U.S. to win the competition to be first to the moon.
HOULTON, Maine — A compliance check recently conducted in Aroostook County to ensure that businesses that sell alcohol are complying with Maine’s liquor laws produced disappointing news, as nearly half of the establishments targeted were cited by police.
Deputy Kris Malmbourg of the Aroostook County Sheriff’s Department said earlier this week that 33 establishments, including restaurants and stores, around The County were checked for liquor law compliance as part of the Underage Drinking, Adult Consequences campaign. Of those, 13 were summoned for violations.
Aroostook County was selected last month as one of only four sites in the nation to participate in the underage drinking project sponsored by the U.S. Department of Transportation and National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
Community Voices, a countywide organization that works to curb substance abuse among youths, was awarded a $325,000 grant, which it is using to work with 11 law enforcement groups on a pilot project to get alcohol out of the hands of minors.
Malmbourg said the most recent compliance checks were part of the initiative and are being conducted to reduce the number of underage drinkers and the number of underage drinking and driving fatalities in The County. They also are being conducted to deter those who provide alcohol to youths.
According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, teens are at far greater risk of death in an alcohol-related crash than the overall population, despite the fact that they are below the minimum drinking age in every state. Thirty one percent of 15- to 20-year-old drivers who were killed in crashes nationally in 2006 had been drinking.
According to Maine’s office of substance abuse, a 2008 statewide survey reported that 48.8 percent of Maine students in grades seven through 12 had tried alcohol. Research also has shown that 40 percent of children who begin drinking before age 15 will develop alcohol abuse or dependence at some point in their lives.
Malmbourg pointed out that 142 people died in Maine from 2006 to 2010 as a result of a crash involving a 15- to 20-year-old driver with a blood alcohol content of 0.01 or above. In 2010 alone, 22 percent of 15- to 20-year-old drivers involved in traffic fatalities in Maine had a blood alcohol content of 0.01 or above.
“One careless decision by a young person can end and destroy lives,” Malmborg said. “We know we have more work to do, but if we got across to just one teen who might have otherwise chosen to drink and drive, we’ve accomplished something and hopefully changed lives. And if we’re able to reduce their access to alcohol, that’s tackling the first part of the problem.”
Along with the 13 establishments summoned for noncompliance, the additional road patrols in Aroostook resulted in youth transportation and possession of alcohol citations, as well as citations for adults furnishing a place for minors to consume and alcohol for minors to consume. Other violations not alcohol-related were dealt with as a result of the increased patrols, ranging from driving violations to drug violations, according to Malmbourg.
“Local enforcement officials and community partners came together for this campaign, and we believe it was a tremendous success,” he said. “Hopefully, the teens in our community now know we will not tolerate underage drinking, and just as importantly, the adults and organizations who provide the alcohol know they also face serious consequences.”
This is not the first time that compliance checks have revealed that not all County businesses are enforcing the state’s liquor laws. In March 2011, the Sheriff’s Department oversaw an operation that had minors attempt to buy alcohol at 43 businesses stretching from Macwahoc to Fort Kent.
Twenty-three of the establishments sold alcohol to the minors and were summoned for the violation, according to Sheriff Jim Madore.
During the summer of 2010 in Caribou, the Police Department selected 12 local businesses where alcohol is served.
Fifty percent of the businesses failed the test and sold the minor alcohol, according to Caribou Chief Mike Gahagan.
Gahagan said at the time that he was stunned by the results, especially since the department offers free responsible beverage training to businesses in the city.
Michelle Plourde Chasse, Community Voices project manager, said Friday afternoon that she also was disappointed with the results. She noted that compliance checks that were conducted in January revealed an almost 50 percent failure rate. That rate is slightly lower this time.
“I wish there was a magic button because I would push it,” she said. “We will continue to offer training twice a year to businesses in this area and we are going to continue with compliance checks.”
The project manager said she believes that it would be helpful to immediately list the names of businesses that were summoned in order to let parents and others know that they were cited. But the names have not been released in the past until the cases were settled in court, and Plourde Chasse did not have the list of businesses that were cited during this round of checks.
Penalties for the violations can result in a fine, license suspension or both. Fines for stores start at between $550 and $1,500 for a first violation, depending on the number of offenses.
The next wave of compliance checks will start this month and the enforcement campaign will continue throughout the year.

Today, News Corp. officially announced plans to split into two separate publicly traded companies. One of the companies will focus on News Corp's booming film and television assets, including 20th Century Fox film studio, Fox News Channel, and Fox broadcast news. The other company will include News Corp's publishing assets, such as the Wall Street Journal, The Times of London, and HarperCollins book publishing. The company's publishing assets have struggled recently in the wake of a phone hacking scandal in Great Britain. In News Corp's last quarterly earnings report, entertainment revenues came to $6.2 billion, while publishing assets only brought in $2 billion. Chief Executive Rupert Murodch will serve as chairman of both companies. He will also be CEO for the entertainment-focused company. No word yet on who will serve as CEO on the publishing side, but Murdoch has dismissed fears that the publishing company will not be able to stand on its own. The transaction will take roughly a year to complete. News of the split's possibility caused News Corp shares to rise sharply over the past couple of days. At the moment, however, shares are down slightly 1.52% at $22.07 a share.

Press Release from the City of Madison:
It's holiday recycling time. Madison residents have the chance to recycle cooking oil from their Thanksgiving feast and non working Holiday lights and extension cords at the Streets Division's drop off sites.
"We know that there are many people who have lots of oil left over after frying their Thanksgiving turkey," Madison recycling coordinator George Dreckmann said. "We are very excited to be able to offer them a chance to turn that old cooking oil into fuel for cars and trucks in our area."
Madison residents who wish to recycle their cooking oil must bring it to one of two Streets Division drop off sites. The sites are located at 1501 W. Badger Rd. on the west side and 4602 Sycamore Av. on the east side. Special cooking oil collection tanks are available at both of these locations.
"Every year thousands of gallons of old cooking oil is tossed in the landfill or flushed down the drain. Since we began our cooking oil program we have recovered over thousands of cooking oil" Dreckmann said. "Now we can recover this resource and use it to reduce our reliance on foreign oil and cut air pollution."
Cooking oil must be brought to the 1501 W. Badger Rd. or 4602 Sycamore Av. It should not be taken to the waste oil sites.
"We know that many residents are changing to new energy efficient LED holiday lights and have lots of older light strings they would like to dispose of," Madison recycling coordinator George Dreckmann said. "We are happy to provide them a recycling option for their old lights."
Madison will accept any light strings as well as old extension cords as part of the program. Residents who have older lights with large bulbs are asked to remove those bulbs. There is no need to remove bulbs from strings of mini lights.
"We will recycle all of the old lights through our electronics recycler Cascade Asset Management of Madison," Dreckmann said. "We will have a specially marked electronic collection container at the sites for the lights."
The sites at Badger Rd. and Sycamore Av. will be open this weekend from 8:30 a.m. until 4:30 p.m. Beginning Monday the sites will be open winter hours M-F from 7:30 a.m. until 4:30 p.m.

Company to pay $81,000 in restitution to Vt. customers
MONTPELIER - The state Department of Financial Regulation announced Tuesday that The Hartford Financial Services Group will pay more than $81,000 in restitution to Vermont customers whose auto insurance claims were not evaluated properly.
An investigation by the department determined that The Hartford had inaccurately calculated the value of total vehicle losses for 77 claims between January 2009 and September 2011. In response, The Hartford has agreed to implement new policies and procedures as well as mandatory training for all employees who handle Vermont claims.
Commissioner Steve Kimbell said he was pleased with the corrective actions the company agreed to take.
"It is always gratifying when a company acknowledges erroneous practices and strives to make improvements," Kimbell said.
The department said it will conduct a follow-up examination in about a year.
View topic - Question About the Particle が
However, despite the risk, I have to ask.
How can I tell whether the が in a sentence is the "Subject Marker" version, or the "But" version?
All I can tell from the two examples given in the Particles page is that the "Subject Marker" version comes after a noun, and that the "But" version always comes after the "Subject Marker" version, and sometimes at the end of the sentence, as a sort of cliffhanger.
Can anyone tell me whether my assumptions are correct, or if I need to know something else?
Any help would be much appreciated.
Thank you for your time, guys.
Well, actually I can.

To directly answer your question, though, the conjunction が will occur after a verb, whereas the subject marker will appear after a noun. (If you can't tell whether you're looking at a verb or a noun, then the meaning of が isn't your primary problem anyhow. ) The conjunction が will also usually have a comma after it (or maybe an ellipsis if nothing comes after it); in speech, there will usually be a pause. So I don't think there are any ambiguous contexts where it might look like it has either meaning.

The Facebook f8 keynote speech by founder Mark Zuckerberg started about 30 minutes ago. Outside of the first 10 minutes of cheesy jokes by Saturday Night Live comedian Andy Samberg, the rest of the talk has seen Zuckerberg painting a picture of a big new overhaul of profiles called ‘Timeline.’
Timeline was described by Zuckerberg as: “All of your stories, all of your apps, a new way to express who you are.” It will also integrate with mobile, to create a more seamless user experience from mobile to web. Timeline will be progressively rolled out over the next few months, and will initially look quite bare.
The new Facebook Timeline will be more visual and include a ‘Cover’, which is one big image to visually "express who you are" – which doesn’t replace the profile picture. Users will also be able to be more easily go back into the archive of content and conversations since they joined Facebook. They will receive weekly or yearly Reports, which will give them a summary of events and activities they have done. The Timeline will also enable a user to Highlight an important event, update or piece of content in order to flag it up on their Timeline.
Facebook have spent the last year working on the Open Graph protocol, which they believe will make it possible to build a completely new ‘social class’ of apps than ever before.
The Open Graph will open up to two additional areas. Currently, its communication, and games and will now open up to media (TV, music, movies, news and books) and lifestyle apps (cooking, eat, emotions, fashion, fitness etc.).
One announcement that almost got a round of applause from the audience, was that users can be engaged with an app and never have a pop up again to authorize and ask if they want to share it on their news feed again. With the new integration of Timeline and Apps, it will presume that if you want to use an app that you want to publish it on your Timeline, which is what Zuckerberg is calling a "frictionless experience." Developers will be able to implement the 'add to Timeline' button on through Open Graph straight after f8, which will work immediately across all platforms.
The ticker feature also enables you to have a "serendipitous experience" with friends, particularly when it comes to music. The founder demonstrated how with Open Graph and music social network Spotify, you can listen along with friends; you see in the ticker feed that your friend is listening to Up, the new single by James Morrison you can simply hover over the alert and listen along. This will also be the case with launch partner, iHeartRadio.
Facebook has also announced the addition of verbs so you will be able to ‘read a book’ or ‘watch a movie.’
There's still a whole day of seminars to go at f8, but I'm off to do some knitting and eat dinner. I'll blog again tomorrow when I've digested the rest of the days events.

Need a good browser CSS editor - where I can save the stylesheet.
I just came across Stylebot for Chrome. Its pretty awesome, except I dont think it allows you to save the stylesheet to your local disk after making changes.
Can somebody refer me to a CSS editor that allows you to save stylesheets?
You can use NotePad++ to save files as .css files.
Style sheets should be universal for any browser. I'd stay away from anything slanted toward one browser or another.
good thinking! lol
I used to have a browser css editor that had the feature to save the stylesheets. I didnt even think to simply just open a notepad or blank document and copy+paste to create my own stylesheets.

Client May Discharge Attorney But Contingent Fee Remains Earned
The Rhode Island Supreme Court affirmed the grant of summary judgment to an attorney in a suit for fees against a former client.
The attorney had represented the client in actions against her late father's estate for a 15% contingency fee.
After the claim was reduced to settlement, the attorney collected his fees as payments were recovered. The client later discharged the attorney and claimed no obligation to continue to pay.
The court found that the attorney's rights under the contingent fee agreement had fully vested when the underlying claim was settled. Although the client was free to discharge the attorney, such action "does not alter his entitlement to fees already earned." (Mike Frisch)

Ann Kathleen Tolbert died when the 2001 Buick LeSabre she was riding in was struck by a 1986 Toyota 4-Runner at Turner McCall Boulevard and North Broad Street around 7:25 p.m., according to GSP spokesman Gordy Wright.
The driver of the Buick, Betty Rowston, 87, and the passengers, Nancy Bryan, 88, Clare Harvey, 77, and Charlene Covington, 81, all of Rome, were taken to Floyd Medical Center for treatment. Rowston, Bryan and Harvey were treated and released while Covington remained in stable condition Monday, according to Floyd Medical Center spokesman Daniel Bevels.
The driver of the 4-Runner, Dalton Cole Warren Grant, 18, of Rome, was not injured.
Sgt. Scott Thompson with the Georgia State Patrol said no eyewitnesses have come forward to say they saw the wreck.
“There are conflicting stories as to what happened,” Thompson said. “We are looking for eyewitnesses to come forward so we can conclude our investigation and give the families some closure.”
The GSP’s Specialized Collision Reconstruction Team is investigating the wreck, Thompson said. It will likely be several days before the investigation is completed, he said.
Anyone with information is asked to call the Georgia State Patrol at 706-295-6004.

Committee for the Preservation of Samples & Cores Meeting Minutes (click on date to
see the minutes):
Committee on Core and Sample Preservation Meeting
June 4, 2001, Denver, Colorado
The committee met from 3:00 to
5:00 p.m., Monday, June 4, 2001 in the Gold Coin Room, Marriott City Center
Hotel, Denver, Colorado. Highlights of the reports and discussion:
- Chris Maples, Chairman of
the National Research Council study on Geoscience Data and Collections described
the study activities and schedule that will lead to a final report in March
2002. The NRC committee meeting in Denver June 7 ? 9, is scheduled to
include tours of the US Geological Survey Core Research Center, the National
Ice Core Laboratory, Denver Earth Resources Library and the Boulder National
Geophysical Data Center.
- Chris Keane and Marcus Milling,
American Geological Institute, provided an update of their work on the National
Geoscience Data Repository System: data is being incorporated into Geotrek
at an accelerating rate; funding for Geotrek is unsure when the current Federal
grant expires at the end of 2001; AGI is hoping that the March 2002 NRC study
will identify multiple government agencies that could provide future funding;
the site receives about 500 ? 600 unique users per month.
Comments from the committee
regarding Geotrek: the AGI needs to do more to publicize its accomplishments;
this committee should work with AGI to update the directory of repositories;
the Geotrek user interface is too slow and requires the user to know the type
of data needed rather than providing all data for a location; greater interaction
between AGI and the state repositories and regulatory agencies is encouraged.
The committee encourages
AGI to increase communication with public/state repositories, perhaps through
a periodic newsletter. This could contribute to increased the amounts
of data being provided to AGI. Communication of lessons learned and best
practices would also help states that are starting to automate their data.
- Tim Carr described the Kansas
Geological Survey online system for data management and distribution.
Committee members were impressed with the large variety of visual and tabular
data in the system and the ease of use. We asked Tim to provide
supplementary information on system costs and its links to Geotrek.
It was also suggested that the Kansas example might be incorporated in a ?best
practices? article for the AAPG Explorer.
- The committee proposed these
future actions: work with AGI to update the Catalogue of Data Repositories;
Explorer articles on ?best practices? for core preservation, the NRC
study, and/or use of core in research; develop presentation material on the
benefits of public/state repositories.
- A conference call will be
scheduled this summer to discuss implementation of next year?s activities

USGS hyrdologists take measurements of the river's "flow rate."
ST. LOUIS (KSDK) - The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers continues to project that the commercial navigation channel on the Mississippi River will remain open between St. Louis, Mo. and Cairo, Ill.
The removal of rock obstructions and recent water releases from the Corps' Carlyle Lake in Illinois have improved the forecast for the Mid-Mississippi River.
Current work on the river will address areas that will have the most immediate impact on the navigation channel, with additional rock removal planned for later this year.
"We believe we will deepen the channel ahead of the worst-case river stage scenario, and I remain confident that navigation will continue," said Maj. Gen. John Peabody, Mississippi Valley Division Commander.
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is in constant communication with the U.S. Coast Guard and the river industry regarding water levels throughout the Mississippi River Basin.
Some of us can recall the helpless feeling of being in a vehicle driven by someone who is intoxicated. If you're like me, you don't want to cause a scene unless the driving is really erratic. But there comes a moment when you need to say: Stop the car. You're going to hurt someone. Hand over the keys.
We have a political system that is the equivalent of a drunk driver. The primary culprits are the House Republicans. They are so intoxicated with their own ideology that they are ready to drive the nation's car off the road. I don't know if the sequestration that began Friday will produce a little crisis or a big one; the sad fact is that the Republicans don't know either, yet they're still willing to put the country at risk to make a political point.
I'm no fan of the way President Obama has handled the fiscal crisis. As I've written often, he needs to provide the presidential leadership that leads Congress and the country toward fiscal stability. In my analogy, he should take the steering wheel firmly in hand and drive the car toward the destination where most road maps show we need to be heading — namely, a balanced program of cuts in Social Security and Medicare and modest increases in revenue.
Instead, Obama has chosen to be co-dependent, as the psychologists say about those who foster the destructive behavior of others. He double-dared the reckless Republicans by proposing the sequester back in 2011. And rather than stepping up to leadership since his re-election, he has triple-dared the GOP hotheads with a partisan inaugural address and weeks of what the Republicans rightly have called a "road show" of blame-game politics. Doesn't he see that the GOP is addicted to this showdown at Thunder Road? This is all the power the GOP has these days, really — the ability to scare the heck out of everybody and run the car into the ditch.
Much as I would criticize Obama, it's wrong to say that both sides are equally to blame for what's about to hit us. This isn't a one-off case of the Republicans using Obama's sequestration legislation to force reckless budget cuts. It's a pattern of behavior: First the Republicans were prepared to shut down the government and damage the national credit rating with their showdown over the debt ceiling; then they were careening toward the "fiscal cliff." This isn't a legislative tactic anymore, it's an addiction.
Where did this recklessness come from? Only a few years ago, George W. Bush was the compassionate conservative and John McCain won the GOP nomination as the Republican who knew how to govern across party lines. What happened to that Republican Party? Today's Republicans seem to suffer from what's sometimes known as Obama Derangement Syndrome, in which their hatred of the president blinds them to the country's interests. To be honest, this malady is eerily similar to the Bush Derangement Syndrome that afflicted Democrats during the previous decade. The Democrats were so incensed back then they stopped caring if America succeeded or failed in Iraq; the Republicans are so angry now that they don't care if the economy goes to hell.
So how can we get these incapacitated drivers to stop before they do any more damage? If this were really a case of chronic drinkers, the answer would be an intervention to keep them off the road. In politics, the public gets to intervene through elections. We just had one, and the Republicans lost, big time. Yet it didn't seem to make much difference. The House Republicans are still grabbing for the wheel and the car is rumbling toward trouble.
Obama tries everything to gain control — except a clear, firm presidential statement that speaks to everyone onboard, those who voted for him and those who didn't — that could get the country where it needs to go.
The weird thing is that, politics aside, there is every reason to be optimistic about America's future. The country's financial markets are resilient; the housing slump finally seems to be ending; a new era of low-cost shale oil and gas is beginning and, as a result, the U.S. is becoming a competitive manufacturing economy again.
There's one ruinously dysfunctional part of the American story, and that's the breakdown of our political system. It's time for an intervention, to take the keys away.

THIS JOB HAS EXPIRED
Lake Orion, Mich. – Part of defending champion Olin Browne’s preparation for the 2012 U.S. Senior Open will be competing in the U.S. Open at The Olympic Club. In addition to negotiating Olympic’s ubiquitous slopes and confounding doglegs, Browne hopes to be distracted by following the progress of his son, Olin Jr.
“O” – as Browne calls his son – is attempting to join his father at a U.S. Open sectional qualifier in Columbus, Ohio, on June 4. Several days before the qualifier, dad still didn’t know whether he would go watch.
“It’s a difficult position to be in,” said the elder Browne at Senior Open Media Day on May 30. “I don’t want to show up and put that kind of heat on him. On the one hand, it’s nice to support for your kid. Whether I’m there or not, he knows that, I love him and support him and I’m pulling for him to do the very best he can.”
If the younger Olin qualifies, the Brownes will be the first father-son duo to play together in the U.S. Open since Jay and Bill Haas achieved the rare feat in 2003 and 2004.
“It would be unbelievable,” said Browne Sr. “He’s thinking about it; he knows I’m thinking about it. He’s got probably a one in 10 chance of making it. So it’s up to him to prepare himself properly. It’s part of the learning process.”
If there is anyone who could impart good advice about sectional qualifying, it would be the elder Browne, who shot 59 at Woodmont Country Club in Rockville, Md., to advance to the 2005 U.S. Open at Pinehurst No. 2 in North Carolina.
Qualifying presents one set of challenges; the championship itself offers others. Despite having the type of controlled game that would seem like a perfect fit for the U.S. Open, Browne’s performance in the championship – one top-10 finish in 11 starts – was less successful. He has fared much better since turning 50, and has yet to finish out of the top 10 in three U.S. Senior Opens, capped by last year’s victory.
This delayed success is fitting for the late bloomer, who didn’t pick up the game until he was 19. Browne didn’t play his first U.S. Open until he was 35, but has felt comfortable on golf’s biggest stage.
“Overall, the USGA setup is fairly consistent, in which every facet of the game is a component of good play” said Browne. “You have to drive the ball well, strike irons consistently, control ball flight, play smart and manage your game well. It’s more of a marathon.”
After getting a glimpse of Indianwood Golf & Country Club, the site of the 2012 U.S. Senior Open, Browne came away with a similar sense of comfort that he possessed last year at Inverness Club in Toledo, Ohio.
“The course is sensational,” said Browne. “I love these kinds of greens that are open in the front.”
Last year, Browne withheld a charge from Mark O’Meara by playing the final 10 holes in one under. It was the culmination of a journey that began when he was just starting to learn the game at the driving range accompanied by his girlfriend – now wife – and they would daydream about winning the national championship.
“We’d talk about the U.S. Open,” Browne recalled. “We didn’t talk about the PGA or the Masters or the [British] Open Championship. It was always the last hole of the U.S. Open. That was my reference point.”
Now that dream has become reality, Browne is relishing his status and basking in the benefits his victory has borne, such as the rare opportunity to potentially share an indelible U.S. Open memory with his son.
“Here we are, 11 months later, and [the U.S. Senior Open win] still has legs,” said Browne. “It’s a source of great pride and it’s a privilege to be seen as a USGA champion.”

Focal length, f/d, etc are irrelevant. The thing that is relevant is
wavelength of your signal. You want the variations in the dish's
surface to be small relative to a wavelength. 1/4 wavelength is
ok. 1/8th wavelength is better. Better than that matters not much.
Its not to hard to get an intuitive feel for what is going
on. Suppose you have a dish that is a perfect paraboloid, except for
one little dent that's a little farther from the focus. Suppose the
dent is 1/2 wavelength farther from the focus than the rest of the
dish. The signal that reflects off of that dent will be 1/2
wavelength late, in other words 180 degrees out of phase with the
rest of the signal, and will therefore SUBTRACT from the rest of the
signal. That isn't good. That's a clue that 1/2 wavelength is too
much variation. You can go thru the same sort of thinking with a 1/4
wavelength dent and see that the effect is much smaller, etc.

You have to admit, trends are unavoidable. Some are so stealthy, maybe even ubiquitous, that it’s hard to tell if something is considered “classic” or if it’s actually trendy.
Sometimes one piece is a classic over the long term, but comes in and out of popularity throughout the years, taking it from something standard to something really trendy and eventually back again.
One of the more recent examples I can think of is the Sperry Top-Sider… a shoe which has resurged in popularity over the past several years, but was actually invented back in the 30s for the sole (pun intended, kinda) purpose of making it safe to run around on a boat deck.
According to some, Top-Siders first gained popularity as an everyday “fashionable” shoe choice in the 80s. Soo… trendy or classic?
Depends on who you ask, I guess. I say classic, considering its history… but if you ask a 14-year-old who first learns of boat shoes at Urban Outfitters, he might consider it trendy.
Could it be both?
Anyway, all of this just to say that it doesn’t really matter. Some things are trendy, some are classic, some are classic that become trendy and go back to being regular ol’ classics again.
Wear what you like
One thing I always tell people who are still figuring out their personal style: Wear what you like. Who cares what other people think, seriously. We’re not in 6th grade anymore. You should wear what you love and what makes you feel good.
At the same time, it’s smart to learn what actually makes you look awesome and shows that you’re an adult with good taste. You may love and feel good wearing garbage bags, but that’s not exactly striking the balance between feeling good / comfortable, and being perceived as a grown ass man with, you know, taste… and a job.
Before I go too far off on a tangent
… here are three ways you can embrace trends (and incorporate them daily) without completely victimizing yourself.
1.) One trendy thing at a time
Any more than that and you approach #menswear peacock status.
Let me be more specific. If it’s a significant piece of your wardrobe (i.e. Go-to-Hell pants), then tone it down on all the other trendy items on your bod that day.
If they’re more subtle, you can probably get away with two or three. So if we’re referring to this photo from GQ, wrist decor like a watch, bracelets, etc, bold socks, and a pocket square are all technically okay to wear at once. It’s when you include all 18 things on this list that you start to peacock the F out, and things just get weird.
2.) Mix your trends with classic styles
So the overall idea here is to be classic and understated, but with a few pops of “F you” and “Go To Hell” here and there.
The #menswear peacock in the image above is classic to a certain extent (traditional silhouettes with a modern slant, overall good taste) but then he takes it to a whole different level with the way he’s executing it: Loud colors, over-accessorizing, and including every imaginable up-to-the-moment trend.
Again, it’s cool rocking a few of these things (max) at a time, just keep it understated overall.
Think about when you buy a really awesome garment, and you discover a hidden detail the designer included that no one knows about but you. You want to treat your accessories and trends that way. Do it, but don’t be obnoxious about it. A peek of color here, a crazy brogue paired with a quiet outfit. You get what I’m saying?
3.) Do the complete opposite
Are fedoras and trilbies the “in” headgear at the moment? Rock your dad’s old baseball cap. I just whipped out this old Polo Sport cap from my closet back home—much to K’s dismay—and I’m rockin it all the time as if it’s 1996 again.
Everyone has 10+ bracelets on their wrists? Wear your best watch, and that’s it.
Go the opposite direction of wherever the trend is headed. Oftentimes trends balloon to excessive proportions before they’re dialed back down again, so forge your own path and do whatever everyone else ISN’T doing.
Just to clarify, I’m not saying put on your old JNCO wide leg jeans and cheap leather square-toed shoes… that’s a path no one should ever go back down.
You can and should adopt certain trends as long as you do it in moderation.
So let me open up the floor to you guys: what other ways can you embrace trends without looking like a complete #menswear peacock / fashion victim? If you have suggestions / ideas / questions, let’s hear em below in the comments.

Lord British was killed during an in-game appearance on Ultima Online’s beta test on August 8, 1997. A royal visit was conducted as a part of server population stress test. A player character known as Rainz cast a spell called “fire field” on Lord British that, surprisingly, killed him. According to Starr Long, the whole thing was just a human error: Lord British’s character, like others, had been made invulnerable, but by design the invulnerability did not persist over several game sessions. Shortly before the incident, the server had crashed, and Richard Garriott had forgotten to set his invulnerability flag on when logging on again. Shortly afterwards, Rainz’s account was banned from the beta test for previously exploiting bugs rather than reporting them (infamously used by his character Aquaman to kill many player characters, a purported griefing incident). According to Origin, he was not banned for the assassination but rather for previous complaints against his account that were brought to light as a result of this attention. The massive amount of lag, caused by the stress test, was a factor in Lord British’s death, as well as the guards being deactivated in the area, which allowed Rainz to steal, avoiding immediate death. 99% of the players were at Lord British’s castle. Only the few at Lord Blackthorn’s castle were the lucky witnesses to this historic event. Those known to have been present besides Lords British and Blackthorn were their jesters Chuckles and Heckles and the following players; Rainz, Dr.Pepper, Mental, DemonSoth, Haaaaaach, Helios, Phobos, Gildoreal, Wind Lord and Kylan.
3) The Epic Heist – EVE Online – November 2005″
This was published in September’s 2005 issue of PC Gamer UK. It is a detailed account of what has to be one of most beautifully executed in-game scams in a MMORPG ever pulled. It breaks all previous world records for ‘virtual crime’.
The game in question is Eve Online, where corporate espionage and political intrigue have become an integral part of the game.
The perpetrator of the heist was the Guiding Hand Social Club (GHSC) corporation (a corporation being similar to a clan in Eve); a freelance mercenary outfit that offers their services (which usually involves corp infiltration, theft and assassination) to the highest bidder. Over a year in planning, the GHSC infilitrated their target’s corp with their own members and gained their trust, as well as access to the corp hangers, with time. It all concluded in a perfectly timed climax, with a massive theft in multiple corp hangars synchronized with the in-game killing of the corporation’s CEO, the primary target of the contract.
What’s most interesting and impressive about this operation is that it was entirely ‘legal’ and within the game’s own rules, and the mastermind and his agents pulled it off together flawlessly, all the while staying in character. The estimated real-life value of the items stolen is, according to PC Gamer, $16,500 US. The in-game value of course is much, much higher as the things stolen would take years and years to aquire.
4) Plague Outbreak – World of Warcraft – September 2005
The Corrupted Blood plague incident was one of the first events to affect entire World of Warcraft servers. Patch 1.7 saw the opening of Zul’Gurub, the game’s first 20-player raid dungeon where players faced off against an ancient tribe of jungle trolls under the sway of the ancient Blood God, Hakkar the Soulflayer. Upon engaging Hakkar, players were stricken by a debuff (a spell that negatively affects a player) called “Corrupted Blood” which would periodically sap their life. The disease would also be passed on to other players who were simply standing in close proximity to an infected person. Originally this malady was confined within the Zul’Gurub instance but made its way into the outside world by way of hunter or warlock pets that contracted the disease.
Within hours Corrupted Blood had infected entire cities such as Ironforge and Orgrimmar because of their high player concentrations. Low-level players were killed in seconds by the high-damage disease. Eventually Blizzard fixed the issue so that the plague could not exist outside of Zul’Gurub.
5) Death of the Sleeper – EverQuest – November 15-17, 2003
The guild Blood of the Spider on The Rathe server was the first guild system-wide to kill Ventani (the fourth warder) on July 28, 2001, and therefore wake the sleeper. The event caused a stir on the server when Kerafyrm went into multiple zones, including Skyshrine, killing everyone and everything in his path.
On November 15, 2003, on the Rallos Zek PvP server, the three top guilds (Ascending Dawn, Wudan, and Magus Imperialis Magicus) assembled over 180 players with the intent to wake and kill The Sleeper. This was in response to an attempt to wake The Sleeper by an Iksar monk named Stynkfyst, who partnered with the largest random-pk guild of the time. Having been a former member of uber-guild Ascending Dawn, he had the knowledge the random pk guild needed to wake The Sleeper. The top guilds did not assemble their forces until word of Stynkfyst’s intentions had spread, and it became clear that he intended to wake The Sleeper, forever preventing future guilds from farming the old loot table. Until this point, waking The Sleeper had not been seriously considered by any guilds, as it was believed that waking The Sleeper would make the offending guild’s players kill-on-sight to the other guilds of the server. After 3 hours and 15 minutes, at 26% health, Kerafyrm disappeared (despawned). The players talked with the EverQuest Game Masters, and there was a general consensus that a bug had caused the problem, although some suggested (backed by statements from one GM) that higher-ups at SOE had purposely despawned Kerafyrm, because it was not intended to be part of the story.
The following day, the players logged in to find that Kerafyrm was back in his “sleeping” state, ready to be triggered again. There was also an apology on the official EverQuest forums from SOE, explaining that they had stopped the encounter because they feared the players were engaging the boss in an unintended manner. Although annoyed (the players pointed out that the reasons SOE gave could not have occurred, and felt lied to), they attempted to battle Kerafyrm once again.
On November 17, 2003, after a nearly 3-hour battle, Kerafyrm was defeated. He had between 100 million and 400 million hit points, likely around 250 million (most EverQuest bosses have 2 million at most), was immune to all spells except wizard’s manaburn spell and Shadow Knight’s Harm Touch, possessed two death touch abilities (abilities that automatically killed players), and attacked players for 6999 damage per swing. By using the cleric’s epic weapon and other resurrection spells, the players were able to bring their dead characters back into the battle faster than Kerafyrm could kill them all.

40 When the messengers arrived at Carmel, they told Abigail, "David has sent us to ask if you will marry him." 41 She bowed low to the ground and responded, "Yes, I am even willing to become a slave to David's servants!"
John 10:26-27 "26 But you don't believe me because you are not part of my flock. 27 My sheep recognize my voice; I know them, and they follow me."Observation:
Nabal was a fool with a beautiful and smart wife (I know what you're thinking here... that could be me at times ;). Even though David has protected him and his servants and flocks, he insults David and his men. David is ready to take vengeance in his own hands, if it wasn't for the sensible Abigail. Today's verse in Proverbs 15:21 says:
"Foolishness brings joy to those who have no sense; a sensible person stays on the right path."This verse very much applied to Nabal and Abigail! What struck me in this passage is the fact that Abigail is ready to leave all her wealth behind and become the wife of a chased-after ragtag band leader. How can that be? Well, Abigail recognizes that David is God's chosen shepherd. She recognizes that he will lead the LORD's people and become the chief-shepherd of His flock. As Jesus says in John 10: "My sheep recognize my voice", so Abigail recognizes God's voice through David and wants to follow him.
I want to become sensible like Abigail, to recognize the voice of the Shepherd in the midst of a dire situation. I want to be forward looking to the time when he will come back to earth a second time, to judge the Nabals of this world, and to gather his flock to take part in the wedding feast.
Dear Heavenly Father, give me 'sense' like Abigail had, and help me to avoid the foolishness and selfishness that Nabal displayed. I want to hear your voice and follow you alone. In Jesus Name, the chief Shepherd. Amen.
Today Pentecost is celebrated across the world, the outpouring of the Holy Spirit. I pray that you may be filled with a holy fire that truly transforms your life. Have a great week.

Title: Landscape ecology and conservation genetics of a rare, sexually deceptive orchid and its obligate pollinator
University: School of Plant Biology, University of Western Australia
Supervisors: Prof. Kingsley Dixon, Prof. Rod Peakall (ANU), and Prof. Raphael Didham (UWA)
Project description: Conservation of complex ecosystems and threatened species requires a detailed understanding of their ecology. Since it is often difficult in highly endemic floras with large numbers of threatened species, such as the Southwest Australian Floristic Region (SWAFR), to research conservation of all threatened species, one approach is to concentrate effort on a model species. Here, we use Drakaea elastica, a nationally threatened, sexually deceptive orchid endemic to the Swan Coastal Plain, Western Australia. The aim of this project is to determine the multi-scale habitat requirements of D. elastica, along with that of its obligate thynnid wasp pollinator, Zaspilothynnus gilesi. This will be complimented by an investigation of population genetics of D. elastica. In addition, a mark-recapture study on Z. gilesi will yield information on movements and vital rates of the wasp, which in turn can affect gene-flow of D. elastica. This research will allow the compilation of a habitat suitability model to guide conservation, such as the designation of protected areas.

What is services marketing?
A service is the action of doing something for someone or something. It is largely intangible (i.e. not material). You cannot touch it. You cannot see it. You cannot taste it. You cannot hear it. You cannot feel it. So a service context creates its own series of challenges for the marketing manager since he or she must communicate the benefits of a service by drawing parallels with imagery and ideas that are more tangible.
A product is tangible (i.e. material) since you can touch it or own it. A service tends to be an experience that is consumed at the point where it is purchased and cannot be owned since it quickly perishes. A person could go to a café one day and enjoy excellent service, and then return the next day and have a poor experience. Marketers talk about the nature of a service as being inseparable, intangible, perishable, homogenous and variable.
Inseparable - from the point where it is consumed, and from the provider of the service. For example, you cannot take a live theatre performance home to consume it (a DVD of the same performance would be a product, not a service). The consumer is actually involved in the production process that they are buying at the same time as it is being produced, for example an eye test or a makeover. One benefit would be that if you are unhappy with you makeover you can tell the beautician and that instant feedback means that the service quality is improved. You can't do that with a product. Another attribute is that services have to be close to the person consuming them i.e. goods can be made in a central factory location which has the benefits of mass production. This localization means that consumption is inseparable from production.
Intangible - cannot have a real, physical presence as does a product. For example, motor insurance may have a certificate, but the financial service itself cannot be touched i.e. it is intangible. This makes it tricky to evaluate the quality of service prior to consuming it since there are fewer attributes of quality in comparison to a product. One way is to consider quality in terms of search, experience and credence.
Search quality is the perception in the mind of the consumer of the quality of the product prior to purchase through making a series of searches. So this is simple in relation to a tangible product because you might look at size or colour for example. Therefore search quality relates more to products and services.
Experience quality is easier to assess. In terms of service you need to taste the food or experience the service level. Therefore your experiences allow you to evaluate the level and nature of the service. You remember a great vacation because of the food or service, but by the same token you remember an awful vacation because of the hopeless food or poor service.
Credence quality is based upon the credibility of the service that you undertake. This is down to the reputation of a dentist or of a decorator. Credence is used where you have little knowledge of the topic and where you rely upon the professionalism of the expert.
Perishable - in that once it has occurred it cannot be repeated in exactly the same way. For example, once a 100 meters Olympic final has been run, there will not be another for 4 more years, and even then it will be staged in a different place with many different finalists. You cannot put service in the warehouse, or store in your inventory. An interesting argument about perishability goes like this, once a flight has taken off you cannot sell that seat again, hence the airline makes no profit on that seat. Therefore the airline has no choice but to price at peak when it sells a seat at busy times in order to make a profit. That's why restaurants offer vouchers to compensate for quieter times, and it is the same for railway tickets and matinees in Broadway during the middle of the week.
Variability- since the human involvement in service provision means that no two services will be completely identical, they are variable. For example, returning to the same garage time and time again for a service on your car might see different levels of customer satisfaction, or speediness of work. If you watch your favourite/favorite music group on DVD the experience will be the same every time you play it, although if you go to see them on tour when they are live no two performances will be identical for a whole variety of reasons. Even with the greatly standardized McDonalds experience, there are slight changes in service, often through no fault of the business itself. Sometimes Saturday lunchtime will be extremely busy, on other days you may have to wait to go via the drive through. So services tend to vary from one user experience to another.
Homogeneity is where services are largely the same (the opposite of variability above). We considered McDonald's above which is a largely homogeneous service, so now let's look at KFC and Pizza Hut. Both of these businesses provide a homogeneous service experience whether you are in New York, or Alaska, or even Adelaide. Consumers expect the same level of service and would not anticipate any huge deviation in their experience. Outside of the main brands you might expect a less homogeneous experience. If you visit your doctor he or she might give one interpretation, whereas another doctor might offer a different view. Your regular hairdresser will deliver a style whereas a hairdresser in the next town could potentially style your hair differently. Therefore standardization is largely embodied by the large global brands which produce services.
Right of ownership is not taken to the service, since you merely experience it. For example, an engineer may service your air-conditioning, but you do not own the service, the engineer or his equipment. You cannot sell it on once it has been consumed, and do not take ownership of it.
Western economies have seen deterioration in their traditional manufacturing industries, and a growth in their service economies. Therefore the marketing mix has seen extended and adapted to create the services marketing mix, also known as the 7P's or the extended marketing mix - physical evidence, process and people.
BELATEDLY, assessments in New York City rose in the mid-80's to reflect the growth in market values. And now, again belatedly, they have begun to drop to reflect the decline.
The 7 percent drop in overall assessments may have been the most significant news embedded in the tentative assessment roll for the 1992 fiscal year made public at City Hall last month. It has been overshadowed for the moment by the awkwardly timed effort by the Dinkins administration to raise as much as $800 million more from the property tax than it is producing this year. To do that, tax rates will have to rise.
Homeowners on average would find their taxes going up about $300 a year from the average bill of $1,340 in the current year. Taxes on apartments -- rentals, co-ops and condominiums -- would on average go up about $230 a unit from a base of $1,430.
The biggest blow would fall on commercial property in Class 4, where billable assessments are still rising from past assessment increases on which taxes are being phased in. Additionally there would be a tax-rate increase of about 12 percent if Mayor David N. Dinkins's fiscal plan is fully enacted.
Property taxes in Class 4 would reach a level approximately double what they were in 1987, according to the Real Estate Board of New York. The year-to-year increase averages out to $1.28 a square foot. For a 10,000-square-foot office tenant, this is a $12,800-a-year rent increase, since tax increases are passed on under standard leases.
Apart from the anomaly of falling assessments and rising property taxes, however, the roll has an interest in its own right. It is the first to be produced under the leadership of Carol O'Cleireican, an economist, as Finance Commissioner. She has pledged a new openness and fairness in the property assessment system. On the first point, she has already made a notable contribution. But on the second, well-wishers may be permitted skepticism. Unfairness in terms of the ratios of assessed values to market values is legislatively built into New York City's assessment system. An argument can be made that the situation is growing worse.
"I know that reform will not be easy," said the Commissioner in a statement that accompanied the publication of the roll, which will become final following adjustments made by the Tax Commission after an appeals period. "But every long journey begins with a first step."
The first steps toward openness have already been taken. This year the Finance Department disclosed to the owners of income-producing properties the figures known as capitalization rates that assessors assign to categories of income-producing property. The assigned rate reflects their judgment of the current value of a building's income stream, or rents after operating expenses are deducted, to a buyer. Rates are influenced largely by geographic location and building age. The lower the rate, the higher the presumed value.
For example, if the net income is $100,000 and the assessors use an 8 percent capitalization rate, the assessed value would be $1.25 million. But if they use a 12 percent rate the valuation would be $833,300.
Last year, owners of so-called Class B office buildings -- older buildings in nonprime locations, including many in Manhattan that were upgraded or changed from manufacturing to office use in the 80's -- organized themselves as the Property Tax Fairness Coalition and commissioned a study by a Los Angeles consulting firm with a Manhattan office, Hamilton Rabinovitz & Alschuler.
At midday a light snow began to fall; the white was a welcome sight. While parts of the country are shoveling out, we here in southwest Wisconsin have needed only a broom. The ground here has been bare most of the winter. It's been great for the farmers who try to get their corn and soybeans harvested before the snow flies.
By late afternoon there was an inch of new white snow on everything--the ground, trees, fence posts, bushes, everywhere. It was nice to see something bright. In Wisconsin, winter just doesn't seem like winter without some snow. I've been itching to slide down a hill on a sled, but I need at least three or four inches before it's soft enough to cushion these old bones. The birds at the birdfeeders seemed extra busy this morning. Blue jays called and flew off in several directions. A pair of cardinals flew by me as I stood in the snow. A gang of black crows sailed high overhead, calling out to me as they passed by.
I noticed a pair of jay-sized birds coming at me from the south and passing right over my head. There was no doubt they were robins. This was a nice treat, even though I saw them for only a few seconds. I think the birds knew there was snow on the way, and when they are busy, they tend to add more life at the start of a day. I broomed the snow off the woodpile and picked up three heavy chunks of split hickory. As I climbed the steps, I wondered where those two robins were headed and where they have been. I can't remember the last time I didn't see a robin in the winter, but it's been at least five years. Seeing the first return of a robin in the spring is not so shocking when you know a few are hanging around all winter. These winter robins are shy and rarely will come to the bird feeders. They prefer to fend for themselves, and they are good at it. They will gladly eat the nutritious berries of chokecherry, wild grapes, serviceberry, and highbush cranberry, but the winter robins' favorite food is the seed found in the dark red tops of the sumac.
Over the years I have shared many winter stories with my readers--stories of the tracks in the deep snow as the landscape turns white. For me it meant a chance to write about how the wildlife survives in a snowy world. So I, for one, am looking for more snow.
An Amish farmer told me the other day about seeing a large white bird on top of a fence post in a hayfield. This, of course, made me very curious, so I had to ask him some more questions. He said the bird was over a foot tall, but seemed to be huddled down over the top of the post. The bird was a hundred yards away, but it looked like there may have been some black spots on its white feathers. The farmer's excellent description was of the great white owl, also known as the snowy owl.
It's always a wonderful treat to see one of these magnificent birds from the far north. Life can be very harsh on the Canadian tundra, and the snowy owl is used to cold winter weather. In the spring and summer they raise their young on the treeless landscape. Food is plentiful and the owls catch voles, lemmings, and flightless young birds. When winter comes, their true hunting skills surface, and they look for hares and ptarmigan. If the hunting is bad, many of these large white owls migrate across the northern boundaries of the U.S. in search of food.
With their large, keen yellow eyes, snowy owls can spot their next meal at a great distance. On huge and silent white wings, they glide low to the ground and surprise their prey. The female great white owl is larger, and her feathers may be heavily barred with black, while the smaller male is lightly barred or pure white. When everything is covered with snow, the great white owl is perfectly camouflaged to blend with its surroundings. With no snow on the ground, though, the snowy owl stands out like a sore thumb. I've spotted them a mile away, sitting motionless in a tree or on top of a fence post. They truly are one of nature's most beautiful and mysterious winter birds.

SCOTTSDALE -- The Arizona Fall League has long been recognized as Major League Baseball's "graduate" school, and on Saturday Paul Konerko picked up his honorary doctorate.Konerko was inducted as the 27th member of the AFL Hall of Fame in ceremonies prior to the Mesa-Salt River game at Salt River Fields at Talking Stick, and his No. 34 as third baseman of the 1996 Sun City Solar Sox was retired by the 20-year-old league. Ryan Howard, a member of the 2004 Phoenix Desert Dogs, is inductee No. 28 -- technically. The AFL doesn't formally induct honorees without their presence, and the Philadelphia first baseman is recovering from an operation on the Achilles tendon he had torn on the final play of the National League Division Series. Howard will be honored next year. So the 2011 spotlight shone solely on Konerko, a Scottsdale resident who became the first local product enshrined in the permanent Hall of Fame displayed in Scottsdale Stadium's concourse. "I'm probably also the first member of the Hall of Fame who came to the games as a kid," said Konerko, whose family moved here from Rhode Island when he was 11. Considering about 3,400 prospects have played through the AFL -- more than 1,200 of them on their way to the big leagues -- inclusion among 28 Hall of Famers is certainly a prestigious honor. One definitely not bestowed upon Konerko for his play in the AFL. "I wasn't too good when I played here," Konerko said, and the record books bear him out, as the Solar Sox's third baseman batted .212 with three homers and 22 RBIs in 44 games. At the time, Konerko was a top prospect in the Dodgers' system, and he also paused in Cincinnati prior to arriving in Chicago, where he made his mark on the South Side. The five-time All-Star recently finished his seventh season with 30-plus homers and his ninth with at least 90 RBIs. Konerko called his induction into one of the few Hall of Fames one may enter while still active "a most pleasant stepping stone." "The AFL has grown up, with more stadiums now, but the core of why it started is the same," Konerko said. "Every organization sends a handful of guys, they're all put together and given a chance to see their best competition. "They grow and become polished together. Ninety percent of these guys will be playing against each other for the next 10 years," added the first baseman and captain -- but not manager -- of the Chicago White Sox. Konerko admitted being taken by surprise by White Sox general manager Ken Williams' admission -- after having already chosen Robin Ventura to replace Ozzie Guillen -- that he had considered Konerko as a player-manager. "That was never even mentioned," Konerko said. "I saw it in the paper, then got a million phone calls, but it was never something that was brought up to me before the manager was announced. "To tell you the truth, I've never thought about managing, not really. It was definitely flattering, but I really have no desire to do that. But I guess it was a compliment." Did being mentioned in that context put Konerko on the map as a future candidate to manage? "In my opinion, I do not see myself ever wanting to do that," he said. "But if you go back to 10 years ago, Robin Ventura probably would've said he doesn't want to manage, either, so you never say never. But as of right now, I don't see myself managing in baseball at any level when I'm done." That will come as a disappointment to Roland Hemond, a former White Sox executive and a principal founder of the AFL. During Saturday's induction ceremony, Hemond looked forward to "taking great pleasure in seeing this man's career continue." And when the time was right, Hemond said, Konerko "would make a great manager in the Arizona Fall League."

Psalm CXXVI. 5492
1. …How man had come into captivity, let us ask the Apostle Paul.…For he saith: “For we know that the Law is spiritual, but I am carnal, sold under sin.” 5493 Behold whence we became captives; because we were sold under sin. Who sold us? We ourselves, who consented to the seducer. We could sell ourselves; we could not redeem ourselves. We sold ourselves by consent of sin, we are redeemed in the faith of righteousness. For innocent blood was given for us, that we might be redeemed. Whatsoever blood he shed in persecuting the righteous, what kind of blood did he shed? Righteous mens blood, indeed, he shed; they were Prophets, righteous men, our fathers, and Martyrs. Whose blood he shed, yet all coming of the offspring of sin. One blood he shed of Him who was not justified, 5494 but born righteous: by shedding that blood, he lost those whom he held. For they p. 604 for whom innocent blood was given were redeemed, and, turned back from their captivity, they sing this Psalm.
2. “When the Lord turned back the captivity of Sion, we became as those that are comforted” (Psa. 126.1). He meant by this to say, we became joyful. When? “When the Lord turned back the captivity of Sion.” What is Sion? Jerusalem, the same is also the eternal Sion. How is Sion eternal, how is Sion captive? In angels eternal, in men captive. For not all the citizens of that city are captives, but those who are away from thence, they are captives. Man was a citizen of Jerusalem, but sold under sin he became a pilgrim. Of his progeny was born the human race, and the captivity of Sion filled all lands. And how is this captivity of Sion a shadow of that Jerusalem? The shadow of that Sion, which was granted to the Jews, in an image, in a figure, was in captivity in Babylonia, and after seventy years that people turned back to its own city. 5495 …But when all time is past, then we return to our country, as after seventy years that people returned from the Babylonish captivity, for Babylon is this world; since Babylon is interpreted “confusion.”…So then this whole life of human affairs is confusion, which belongeth not unto God. In this confusion, in this Babylonish land, Sion is held captive. But “the Lord hath turned back the captivity of Sion.” “And we became,” he saith, “as those that are comforted.” That is, we rejoiced as receiving consolation. Consolation is not save for the unhappy, consolation is not save for them that groan, that mourn. Wherefore, “as those that are comforted,” except because we are still mourning? We mourn for our present lot, we are comforted in hope: when the present is passed by, of our mourning will come everlasting joy, when there will be no need of consolation, because we shall be wounded with no distress. But wherefore saith he “as” those that are comforted, and saith not comforted? This word “as,” is not always put for likeness: when we say “As,” it sometimes refers to the actual case, sometimes to likeness: here it is with reference to the actual case.…Walk therefore in Christ, and sing rejoicing, sing as one that is comforted; because He went before thee who hath commanded thee to follow Him.
3. “Then was our mouth filled with joy, and our tongue with exultation” (Psa. 126.2). That mouth, brethren, which we have in our body, how is it “filled with joy”? It useth not to be “filled,” save with meat, or drink, or some such thing put into the mouth. Sometimes our mouth is filled; and it is more that we say to your holiness, 5496 when we have our mouth full, we cannot speak. But we have a mouth within, that is, in the heart, whence whatsoever proceedeth, if it is evil, defileth us, if it is good, cleanseth us. For concerning this very mouth ye heard when the Gospel was read. For the Jews reproached the Lord, because His disciples ate with unwashen hands. 5497 They reproached who had cleanness without; and within were full of stains. They reproached, whose righteousness was only in the eyes of men. But the Lord sought our inward cleanness, which if we have, the outside must needs be clean also. “Cleanse,” He saith, “the inside,” and “the outside shall be clean also.” 5498 …
4. But let us return to what was just now read from the Gospel, relating to the verse before us, “Our mouth was filled with joy, and our tongue with delight:” for we are inquiring what mouth and what tongue. Listen, beloved brethren. The Lord was scoffed at, because His disciples ate with unwashed hands. The Lord answered them as was fitting, and said unto the crowds whom He had called unto Him, “Hear ye all, and understand: not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.” 5499 What is this? when He said, what goeth into the mouth, He meant only the mouth of the body. For meat goeth in, and meats defile not a man; because, “All things are clean to the clean;” and, “every creature of God is good, and none to be refused, if it be received with thanksgiving.” 5500 …
5. Guard the mouth of thy heart from evil, and thou wilt be innocent: the tongue of thy body will be innocent, thy hands will be innocent; even thy feet will be innocent, thy eyes, thy ears, will be innocent; all thy members will serve under righteousness, because a righteous commander hath thy heart. “Then shall they say among the heathen, the Lord hath done great things for them.”
6. “Yea, the Lord hath done great things for us already, whereof we rejoice” (Psa. 126.3). Consider, my brethren, if Sion doth not at present say this among the heathen, throughout the whole world; consider if men are not running unto the Church. In the whole world our redemption is received; Amen is answered. The dwellers in Jerusalem, therefore, captive, destined to return, pilgrims, sighing for their country, speak thus among the heathen. What do they say? “The Lord hath done great things for us, whereof we rejoice.” Have they done anything for themselves? They have done ill with themselves, for they have sold themselves under sin. The Redeemer came, and did the good things for them.
7. “Turn our captivity, O Lord, as the torrents in the south” (Psa. 126.4). Consider, my p. 605 brethren, what this meaneth.…As torrents are turned in the south, so turn our captivity. In a certain passage Scripture saith, in admonishing us concerning good works, “Thy sins also shall melt away, even as the ice in fair warm weather.” 5501 Our sins therefore bound us. How? As the cold bindeth the water that it run not. Bound with the frost of our sins, we have frozen. But the south wind is a warm wind: when the south wind blows, the ice melts, and the torrents are filled. Now winter streams are called torrents; for filled with sudden rains they run with great force. We had therefore become frozen in captivity; our sins bound us: the south wind the Holy Spirit hath blown: our sins are forgiven us, we are released from the frost of iniquity; as the ice in fair weather, our sins are melted. Let us run unto our country, as the torrents in the south.…
8. For the next words are, “They that sow in tears, shall reap in joy” (Psa. 126.5). In this life, which is full of tears, let us sow. What shall we sow? Good works. Works of mercy are our seeds: of which seeds the Apostle saith, “Let us not be weary in well doing; for in due season we shall reap if we faint not.” 5502 Speaking therefore of almsgiving itself, what saith he? “This I say; he that soweth sparingly, shall reap also sparingly.” 5503 He therefore who soweth plentifully, shall reap plentifully: he who soweth sparingly, shall reap also sparingly: and he that soweth nothing, shall reap nothing. Why do ye long for ample estates, where ye may sow plentifully? There is not a wider field on which ye can sow than Christ, who hath willed that we should sow in Himself. Your soil is the Church; sow as much as ye can. But thou hast not enough to do this. Hast thou the will? 5504 As what thou hadst would be nothing, if thou hadst not a good will; so do not despond, because thou hast not, if thou hast a good will. For what dost thou sow? Mercy. And what wilt thou reap? Peace. Said the Angels, Peace on earth unto rich men? No, but, “Peace on earth unto men of a good will.” 5505 Zacchæus had a strong will, Zacchæus had great charity. 5506 …Did then that widow who cast her two farthings into the treasury, sow little? Nay, as much as Zacchæus. For she had narrower means, but an equal will. She gave her two mites 5507 with as good a will as Zacchæus gave the half of his patrimony. If thou consider what they gave, thou wilt find their gifts different; if thou look to the source, thou wilt find them equal; she gave whatever she had, and he gave what he had.…But if they are beggars whose profession is asking alms, in trouble they also have what to bestow upon one another. God hath not so forsaken them, but that they have wherein they may be tried by their bestowing of alms. This man cannot walk; he who can walk, lendeth his feet to the lame; he who seeth, lendeth his eyes to the blind; and he who is young and sound, lendeth his strength to the old or the infirm, carrieth him: the one is poor, the other is rich.
9. Sometimes also the rich man is found to be poor, and something is bestowed upon him by the poor. Somebody cometh to a river, so much the more delicate as he is more rich; he cannot pass over: if he were to pass over with bare limbs, he would catch cold, would be ill, would die: a poor man more active in body cometh up: he carries the rich man over; he giveth alms unto the rich. Think not therefore those only poor, who have not money.…Thus love ye, thus be ye affectioned unto one another. Attend not solely to yourselves: but to those who are in want around you. But because these things take place in this life with troubles and cares, faint not. Ye sow in tears, ye shall reap in joy.
10. How, my brethren? When the farmer goeth forth with the plough, carrying seed, is not the wind sometimes keen, and doth not the shower sometimes deter him? He looketh to the sky, seeth it lowering, shivers with cold, nevertheless goeth forth, and soweth. For he feareth lest while he is observing the foul weather, and awaiting sunshine, the time may pass away, and he may not find anything to reap. Put not off, my brethren; sow in wintry weather, sow good works, even while ye weep; for, “They that sow in tears, shall reap in joy.” They sow their seed, good will, and good works. “They went on their way and wept, casting their seed” (Psa. 126.6). Why did they weep? Because they were among the miserable, and were themselves miserable. It is better, my brethren, that no man should be miserable, than that thou shouldest do alms.…Nevertheless, as long as there are objects for its exercise, let us not fail amid those troubles to sow our seed. Although we sow in tears, yet shall we reap in joy. For in that resurrection of the dead, each man shall receive his own sheaves, that is, the produce of his seed, the crown of joys and of delight. Then will there be a joyous triumph, when we shall laugh at death, wherein we groaned before: then shall they say to death, “O death, where is thy strife? O death, where is thy sting?” 5508 But why do they now rejoice? Because “they bring their sheaves with them.”
11. In this Psalm we have chiefly exhorted you to do deeds of alms, because it is thence that we ascend; and ye see that he who ascendp. 606 eth, singeth the song of steps. Remember: do not love to descend, instead of to ascend, but reflect upon your ascent: because he who descended from Jerusalem to Jericho fell among thieves. 5509 …The Samaritan as He passed by slighted us not: He healed us, He raised us upon His beast, upon His flesh; He led us to the inn, that is, the Church; He entrusted us to the host, that is, to the Apostle; He gave two pence, whereby we might be healed, 5510 the love of God, and the love of our neighbour. The Apostle spent more; for, though it was allowed unto all the Apostles to receive, as Christs soldiers, pay from Christs subjects, 5511 that Apostle, nevertheless, toiled with his own hands, and excused the subjects the maintenance owing to him. 5512 All this hath already happened: if we have descended, and have been wounded; let us ascend, let us sing, and make progress, in order that we may arrive.

Brookvale, NSW ( ForPressRelease ) August 21, 2012 - CAN (Mental Health) Inc. is very excited to announce that it's extending its national peer support service (Phone Connections) to include people living with the dual disability of mental illness and deafness, every Friday evening from 6pm - 11pm. To provide access to its peer support service the organisation now has:
- Skype Video Conferencing and
- Online Chat capabilities
This important service enables people to decrease social isolation and increase social connection by having a touch base chat about their day or week.
People with the dual disability of mental illness and deafness are some of the most isolated in our community. "To be able to provide peer support to our colleagues in the deaf community is not only exciting it is very sorely needed".
Phone Connections is not a crisis line, nor a clinical or counseling service. Peer support is based on equality, mutuality, hope and understanding and is a complimentary pathway to clinical services. Phone Connections has been operating for 5 years and is very highly regarded both by consumers who access the service and other providers. At this stage we can only offer this much needed service to people with the dual disability of mental illness and deafness one evening per week (Fridays).
Access to Phone Connections is FREE and the person can remain with the service for as long as they like. The peer support staff is very experienced and very highly trained. "To receive a touch base phone call can make all the difference to a person's day. It may be the only call the person receives for the week to let them know that someone cares about them", Ms Casey, Executive Officer said. "Even when not at home the fact the staff leaves a message lets the person know that someone is thinking about them".
Whilst providing this highly sought after peer support service to the deaf community is new, this exciting and innovative initiative taps into the technology that is available for the whole community. This population group has been largely ignored by the overall mental health community for far too long.
Skype video conferencing will be available where the peer support worker can make the conference call within a designated time frame, just like CAN's other Phone Connections staff who ring people via phone. All the person has to do is request a Skype video conference call during the Friday evenings of operation. This can be undertaken by:
- Registering online
- Sending an email
- Requesting a friend or relative to ring on 02 9114 8150 (Sydney metropolitan) or 1300 135 846 (Intra and Interstate) callers and leave a message; or
- Touching base via the Online Chat

Issue | Canada engages in a new approach to resolve specific claims made by First Nations.
Synopsis | The Specific Claims Tribunal Act established an administrative tribunal with the authority to make binding decisions on claims and to award monetary compensation up to $150 million per claim. Claims over $150 million will be dealt with through a specially mandated Cabinet process.
Timing | Under the Specific Claims Tribunal Act, certain claims will be eligible for filing with the Specific Claims Tribunal as of 16 October 2011.
Federal policy divides Aboriginal land claims into two broad categories: specific claims and comprehensive claims. Specific claims arise from the alleged non-fulfillment of historic treaties between First Nations and the Crown, or improper administration of First Nations lands and other assets by the Crown. Comprehensive claims are based on the assertion of continuing Aboriginal rights and title that have not been dealt with by treaty or other legal means. This overview focuses on the specific claims process.
Between April 2010 and April 2011, 18 specific claims were settled at a total value of approximately $666 million. The monetary value of the claims settled in this period ranged from $134,283 to $231.4 million. As of 5 April 2011, 503 specific claims remain in the federal inventory of claims under assessment or in negotiations.1
Over the past several years, the federal specific claims process has been the subject of legal and policy reform initiatives intended to reduce the backlog of outstanding claims. In response to a 2006 report of the Standing Senate Committee on Aboriginal Peoples, which highlighted the need for reforms to the specific claims process in several areas, the federal government launched Specific Claims: Justice at Last – Canada’s Specific Claims Action Plan in June 2007. The reforms proposed in the action plan included an independent tribunal to make binding decisions on claims that cannot be resolved by negotiations, dedicated funding for specific claims settlements, and practical measures to improve the processing of both small and large claims.2
|Location of Specific Claims Under Assessment or in Negotiations (as of 5 April 2011)|
|Source: Figure prepared by the Library of Parliament using data obtained from Indian and Northern Affairs Canada.|
The Specific Claims Tribunal Act was introduced in the House of Commons on 27 November 2007 and came into force on 16 October 2008. The Act creates the Specific Claims Tribunal, an administrative tribunal composed of Superior Court judges with authority to make binding decisions on claims and to award monetary compensation up to a maximum of $150 million per claim.
The Act stipulates that a First Nation may file a claim with the tribunal if the claim has been previously filed with the minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development, and if:
In effect, the Specific Claims Tribunal Act introduces three-year timelines for the assessment and negotiation of specific claims. As a result of these timelines, certain cases will become eligible for filing with the tribunal as of 16 October 2011.
With this deadline in view, the Specific Claims Tribunal is currently preparing for the commencement of operations. Between November 2009 and November 2010, several Superior Court judges were appointed to the tribunal, and Justice Harry Slade was appointed as its chairperson. Draft Rules of Practice and Procedure were made public in June 2010 and are currently under review by the Department of Justice. The tribunal’s first annual report, dated 30 September 2010, provides a synopsis of work undertaken to that date and of anticipated activities through the current and following fiscal years.3
The introduction of the Specific Claims Tribunal Act in November 2007 was accompanied by the signing of a political agreement between the Minister of Indian Affairs and Northern Development and the National Chief of the Assembly of First Nations. The political agreement provides for additional discussion on improvements in the resolution of specific claims not directly addressed in the legislation, including matters related to claims that exceed the monetary cap of $150 million. The development of a Cabinet process to address claims over $150 million is ongoing.

Nightclub fire kills 245 in southern Brazil
SANTA MARIA: At least 245 people died early on Sunday when a fire tore through a nightclub packed with university students in the southern Brazilian city of Santa Maria, police said.
The death toll from the inferno stood initially at 70 but rapidly increased as firefighters searched the charred remains of the “Kiss” club, believed to have been packed with 300-400 revelers at the time of the blaze.
Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff cut short a visit to Chile, where she was attending a European and Latin American summit, to head to Santa Maria and oversee the response to the tragedy, a Brazilian official said.
It was not immediately clear what caused the blaze, but media reports said the fire broke out after 2:00 am (0400 GMT) when the nightclub was hosting a university party featuring a rock band using pyrotechnics.
Santa Maria fire chief Guido de Melo said the fire caused widespread panic, and that many revelers were trampled or died from smoke inhalation.
“The main cause of death was asphyxiation,” de Melo was quoted as saying by Estadao newspaper.
Major Cleberson Bastianello, a military police commander in Santa Maria, confirmed that 245 people had been killed and told AFP another 48 had been taken to the hospital, an indication that the toll could climb further.
Pictures published by local media showed firefighters dousing the blackened shell of a red brick building with water to put out the flames.
“We have just gotten the fire under control,” Colonel Silvia Fuchs of the local fire department was quoted by the G1 website as saying. “Now we are removing the bodies.”
The bodies were taken to a sports stadium that was blocked off by police to keep grieving family members from streaming in. O Globo said a first truck carried 67 corpses followed by another with around 70.
Family members were gathering outside in the hope of getting news of their loved ones. The town is home to the Federal University of Santa Maria.

What Fred Wilpon told The New Yorker doesn't matter. It matters like a team that is 20 games out needs to set a postseason rotation. It matters like a guy on The Titanic needed to figure out how to survive The Great Depression. It mattered like calling the right play for the Washington Generals matters.
This will be a relic of Fred Wilpon's very late career as owner of the New York Mets. There's no realistic financial path forward for him.
Let's stipulate the following: no one can predict the future. But when the Mets were in fourth place on September 1 of last year, 13 games out, no one treated it like a coin flip whether they'd make the playoffs or not. It wasn't going to happen, in all likelihood. And it didn't.
Anyone who tries to tell you the Wilpons don't face the same kind of odds to hold onto this team, be it Fred Wilpon or anyone else, shouldn't be taken seriously. Let's be clear: if the long-discussed minority owner is found to give the Wilpons (or more accurately, Sterling Equities), that is reported to be, best-case, $200 million. With losses expected to be $70 million this year, a $22 million debt balloon payment due on Citi Field in June, and $25 million due back to Major League Baseball by the end of the season, that leaves around $85 million over, assuming no other expenses, planning for 2012 losses, or the next debt balloon payment on Citi Field.
But let's say the Wilpons hold onto that entire $85 million, and apply it toward the lawsuit they face from the Trustee for the Bernie Madoff victims, Irving Picard.
Picard wants $1 billion. That's a lot more than $85 million.
And let's paint the rosiest scenario- somehow, though Picard has been settling with people for 99 cents on the dollar, the Wilpons convince the bankruptcy judge to see things their way regarding Picard's allegations that they should have known Madoff was a fraud. (Remember, every time you hear the Wilpons or allies declare publicly that they didn't know, it doesn't matter. That's not the standard here.)
Even then, the Wilpons owe $300 million in the cash in minus cash out formulation Picard has created for net winners. That's been litigated by Picard, regarding Madoff, before this bankruptcy judge.
So where are they getting that money in an absolute best-case scenario? And remember: they can't sell 49 percent of the team twice and still hold ownership.
I suppose the absolute best-case scenario calls for all that, plus the judge ruling against himself, or Irving Picard having a change of heart, or the Sterling partners winning Powerball. And then again. And then again.
But every time you read a story about the financials of the New York Mets, if the Wilpons don't look like they are in fourth place, 13 games out, with a month to go, that reporter isn't paying attention, either.
So take Fred Wilpon's comments accordingly. They are shockingly stupid in terms of the effect on team morale and attendance. But financially, it is impossible to see how the Mets can afford Jose Reyes either way, and around the league, other teams already knew this. Carlos Beltran was a goner anyway. And David Wright, one hopes, will be more accurately evaluated by the new owner.
Who is coming. And soon.
Nowadays — in both the novel and in actuality — Maxine's younger sister, Bonnie, is happily married to a nonmusical retired physician. She stays in Motel 6's and accepts the fact that diner waitresses no longer recognize her. Back in the 1950s, however, she was Elvis's secret sweetheart (and so busty that the producers of The Ed Sullivan Show insisted on sewing another piece of cloth over her stage costume for a broadcast).
As the Browns savor their fame, Bass foreshadows the real-life blows they would absorb in later years: the accidental death at age 12 of the Browns' richly talented youngest brother; the damage to Jim Ed's guitar-picking fingers when he stumbled while operating a circular saw; and Elvis growing distant and mean as his rising star leaves the Browns earthbound in the Arkansas woods.
Gallant Jim Ed Brown is perhaps the least developed character in Bass's perceptive portrayal. Though the young man eagerly joined Elvis in hotel rooms to receive groupies, he comes across as stolid in later life, blithely carrying on as a minor solo act. (Jim Ed learned to play the guitar again, using different fingers, and he did ultimately partner with a major talent: country singer Helen Cornelius.)
Readers taking stock of their own lives are apt to sympathize most with the long-suffering Maxine. We come to care about her and count on her for the novel's tension as she confronts the reality, as Bass puts it, of a time "when the contracts vanished and the Browns disbanded — and before she made her uneasy peace with that new accommodation, the cessation of fame."
If the Browns were more prominent today, Rick Bass's novel might not have achieved the suspense it manages to deliver. Perhaps the group was jinxed; perhaps brother-sister acts came to seem cornball; or perhaps the bitch goddess of Fame is simply a false idol.
Bass's Maxine proclaims that the Browns opened the gates for such glorious successors as Dolly Parton and Loretta Lynn, and that Kenny Chesney and Garth Brooks both owe her thank-you notes. Perhaps she'll take solace in a shout-out called Nashville Chrome.
Charlie Clark, a Washington writer, got hooked on oldies by the Browns in the early 1980s.
Brave Guinness doesn’t like thunderstorms. I know that many dogs dislike thunder, but I find something funny about a 140 pound zombie hunter being afraid of loud noises. Usually the big baby finds me and hides under my feet when the thunder starts. I guess I’m the alpha-male, so he knows I’ll protect him. On the night of this tale I was traveling, so Guinness was the resident alpha-male, though I don’t think he understood what responsibilities the title imparted. read more »

We have a rule in our house that states, “Happy tails never get punished.” This rule harkens back to the halcyon days when Cozy was a puppy, circa 1997. Lauren and I were newlyweds, we had a beautiful, clean house, and our precocious little pup had grown enough that her tail could sweep the coffee table clean with one wag. We were young, eager to please parents of our first puppy, so our rules were designed to foster the long-term happiness of our fuzzy little bundle of joy.
Fast-forward thirteen years. Our house now has two pre-teen children. The pretty green carpet in the picture has been ruined (by dogs) and removed. Cozy and Daisy have long since passed over the Rainbow Bridge. Now Annie and Guinness rule the roost, but still the rule remains, “Happy tails never get punished.” read more »
I am honored to have been asked by Ricman to write up a bio for Peenut Guy, the main character in a comic he’s been drawing. Peenut Guy can be seen on his webpage over at PeenutGuy.com, and for you guitar-lovers out there, the strip is posted daily on TheGearPage.net.
Who is Peenut Guy? He is you and me. He’s every one of us who’s had a bad day. He is every one of us that’s ever made a mistake or a poor decision. There is one defining characteristic of Peenut Guy that separates him from most of us though:
Peenut Guy never lets life get him down. read more »
Somehow, a box of tissues wound up on the floor. In a normal house, this would be a virtual non-event. Someone would walk by, see them, pick them up, and put them away. Luckily for you, we live in a house where people don’t seem bothered by boxes of tissues in odd places. I’d be wiling to bet that I could glue an inverted box of tissues to the living room ceiling and not hear a word about it for months. Unless someone sneezed, in which case I’d be asked where the tissues were. In such a situation I might reply with a single finger pointed up, resulting in wonder and excitement from my children who would have completely missed the point of the exercise.
This time though, the tissues were left on the floor where we all stepped over them for days. One day something changed, at which point I stopped and stared, trying to figure out what had caught my eye. Then it struck me; the tissues were suddenly outside the box. read more »
Here in the woods of New Jersey, when the leaves start to fall and the temperature drops, we all tend to spend more time indoors. And by “we”, I mean family, dogs, and the filthy vermin commonly known as mice.
Our rodent problem is not a unique one. Go to any hardware store around here in October, and you’ll see the mousetrap section picked over like the dairy aisle in a supermarket before a hurricane.
I tend to be a “live and let live” kind of guy. In the past I’ve used live traps so that I could release the gentle creatures into the wild where they might frolic and play. Those days are gone I’m afraid—now I kill ‘em dead. I felt bad while disposing of the first thirty or so. After fifteen years of battle, I now have the blackened soul of a cold-hearted executioner. My wife though, she’s the scary one. read more »

The speed with which office development happens in Ireland often produces buildings which have no relationship to their environment. They are placed and constructed from so-called ‘practical’ or ‘utilitarian’ reasons. Given specific time constraints and specific environmental and functional constraints how can architecture be created from purely utilitarian interpretation of these constraints? That is the problem we had to solve in the design of SAP Galway’s building.
The building had to be completely designed before site selection was finalized; therefore it was decided to treat the function, a workplace with a specific task for a software company, and the environment, Longitude 9° W and Latitude 53° 15’ N, as the site. A building optimized to these conditions could fit in any site. The building is designed to create a balanced environment for employee comfort and working, which used the minimum amount of energy from non-renewable resources. The building environmentally is a high density occupancy building with high ventilation demand and high cooling load. Free cooling using outside air is the only cooling source utilized. An atrium separates office floor-plates which are connected via bridge structures.
On the floor-plates are the work spaces, and on the bridges are the relaxing zone. The atrium is the driving environmental force for the building and obviates the need for mechanical extraction systems. The concrete frame is exposed pre-cast structure, the façade and atrium have been designed to optimize natural light, shading, and ventilation of the office space.
SAP’s Galway facility is a ‘Contact Centre’: a place where direct technical queries are received and dealt with on the telephone. This is SAP’s first contact centre internationally, therefore it was important that the building be both flexible, and tailored for the work-culture.
The age profile is young, 19-21, post leaving cert: at this age people have little or no experience of working in an office. This being their first office experience it will condition their performance and expectations vis-à-vis workplace etiquette, practices, the relationship between what they do and the environment within which they do it.
Language is controlling feature of team composition. Teams deal with a specific language or language groups, therefore the overall composition of the office is highly international.
Productivity is key; knowledge sharing may happen between people, however due to the fact that they answer queries over the telephone they will not ‘overhear’ conversations about similar problems. It is anticipated that similar issues will be dealt with by circulating them via email. 6min. response time means that people must think on their feet, and generally should not need to consult directly with colleagues.
Innovative and technically accomplished- this is a "prototype" office building designed for a site of an assumed orientation. Its elegant form and construction derive from clear rational planning, meticulous detailing and flawless construction. The atrium drives the environmental design while creating a spatially rich interior environment for the building users.
Baltimore, MD (Sports Network) - Ray Lewis danced one final time on the M&T Bank Stadium turf as the city of Baltimore celebrated the Ravens' victory in Super Bowl XLVII with a raucous celebration on Tuesday.
An overflow crowd reveled in Sunday's 34-31 victory over the San Francisco 49ers in New Orleans, which gave Baltimore its first title of any kind since the Ravens routed the New York Giants in Super Bowl XXXV back in January of 2001, with thousands of fans lined throughout the city streets and the stadium also showing their appreciation for Lewis as the beloved team icon begins his retirement after a remarkable 17-year run with the organization.
Quarterback Joe Flacco drew his share of cheers as well for his MVP performance in Sunday's thrilling win, while safety Ed Reed added a little singing to Lewis' trademark "Squirrel Dance" out of the entrance tunnel by belting out a rendition of Eddie Money's "Two Tickets to Paradise" and leading the familiar chorus of the White Stripes' "Seven Nation Army" during the rally.
Still, the main attraction was undoubtedly Lewis, the franchise's most decorated and recognizable player and the only remaining member from the Ravens' first Super Bowl triumph 12 years ago, as the 37-year-old concluded his self-termed "last ride."
The two-time NFL Defensive Player of the Year and Super Bowl XXXV MVP gave plenty of affection back to the city where he spent his entire pro career while addressing the crowd at the rally.
"There is nothing in the world, there is no place on this earth, that is better than Baltimore," Lewis said. "We believed in each other from day one, from 1996 to now.
"The only way on my last ride to pay Baltimore back for everything you did for me and all the support you gave to me, was to bring back the Lombardi Trophy to Baltimore one more time. I love you, Baltimore. Baltimore! Forever my city."
Reed, an impending free agent with an uncertain future with the team, took the podium next and took a slight jab at the team the Ravens toppled to claim the Lombardi Trophy.
"Who's got it better than who?," he said in a reference to 49ers head coach Jim Harbaugh's famed team rallying cry of "Who's got it better than us?"
Harbaugh, of course, is the younger brother of Ravens sideline boss John Harbaugh, who wrapped up the festivities by leading the crowd in a team chant after thanking the fans for their support.
"Our team, I'm talking about all of us, one of the keys was our determination," said Harbaugh. "We played with incredible determination and resolve. And judging by how hard it was to get into this stadium, I would say that's true about our fans, too. We're on the parade coming down here, and every cranny, every sidewalk is full. Every opening where it opens up, every grassy knoll is packed with Ravens fans. They broke down the barriers behind Ray Lewis and mobbed the streets, right? They filled the streets.
"The city's going crazy! For the Ravens! The world champion Baltimore Ravens!"
The celebration began shortly before noon ET at City Hall and continued with a parade through the streets until the team reached M&T Bank Stadium.
Will county give low-income seniors the tax break OK'd by voters?
Published: Thursday, February 7, 2013 at 5:17 p.m.
Last Modified: Thursday, February 7, 2013 at 5:17 p.m.
Like many local residents Irvin Curtin was looking for a break — a tax break, to be specific.
Curtin recently approached the County Commission to request implementation of Amendment 11, a newly passed provision to the state Constitution that grants certain low-income senior citizens a reduction in their property tax rates.
"I've lived a long time. I've seen so many property tax increases, and other kinds of tax increases, that it just boggles the mind. And I think this is a worthwhile thing," the Belleview-area retiree told the board.
One commissioner agreed, and one didn't, clearly indicating his opposition.
Which means any hope of relief for Curtin and other senior citizens in his situation are pinned on all three remaining commissioners being convinced to open another loophole in an already well ventilated property tax system.
Amendment 11 authorizes cities and counties to enact a homestead exemption for people 65 and older who meet the following criteria: They must have a household income of less than $27,030; own a home whose market value is less than $250,000; and have lived in that home for at least 25 years.
Proponents say its passage would effectively eliminate property taxes for qualified homeowners.
In Marion County the reduction in revenue from enacting Amendment 11 would be miniscule. A county report estimates that qualified taxpayers collectively would save $162,234.
Critics of Amendment 11 maintain that local governments just could not afford another tax break as revenues keep declining.
According to an annual report Property Appraiser Villie Smith compiles about local land values, the state has authorized 38 tax breaks for property owners.
That includes exemptions for both land and for personal — or tangible — property.
The homestead exemption, which slashes up to $50,000 off the taxable value of residences, is the best known and most popular. It is claimed by about 93,000 homeowners in Marion County.
Other tax breaks contained in Smith's report cover nearly 5,000 parcels of publicly owned land, including schools; 1,008 parcels owned by churches and charitable organizations, including health care providers; 11,146 parcels owned by widows and widowers; 6,816 parcels owned by the partially or totally disabled and the blind, including military veterans; 42 parcels set aside for environmental conservation; and 10 parcels owned by deployed military personnel.
Across the county, those exemptions reduced the overall taxable value of property by $6.4 billion in 2012.
Those property tax breaks saved taxpayers across Marion County about $45.3 million last year. That's about $800,000 more than the $44.5 million the county budgeted for property tax revenues for 2013.
In his pro-Amendment 11 pitch to the County Commission, Curtin pointed out that he collects about $1,100 a month in Social Security, while his property taxes ran about $1,400 per year.
He added that he once used his federal income tax rebate to pay his property taxes, but could no longer do so after retiring.
Curtin had an advocate on the board, Commissioner Earl Arnett, who dropped Amendment 11 on his colleagues on Tuesday as his first big policy issue.
Arnett argued that the public had clearly voiced its preference by overwhelmingly supporting Amendment 11.
The amendment was one of just three proposed changes to the Florida Constitution to pass last November. The other two also were property tax-related, providing breaks for families of military veterans or first responders.
Amendment 11 received 61 percent of the vote statewide and 61 percent within Marion County.
"The voting public has told us, as commissioners, that they would like to see this exemption for our seniors," Arnett said.
"Most of our seniors that have owned a home for 25 years are responsible. They pay their taxes. They pay their mortgage. They just don't have the funds left for the nutrition that they need and for the prescriptions," Arnett said.
Yet Commissioner Stan McClain announced he would oppose Amendment 11 — as, he said, he has opposed other property tax exemptions.
Every new tax break, McClain said, requires other taxpayers "to pick up the slack" and creates a demand from other groups for even more tax exemptions.
"Pretty soon, there's going to be a small amount of people paying property tax," McClain said. "We end up in a circular firing squad when we do this."
"It's not fair to everyone else. We have to think of the greater good of the community."
It's unclear when the board might reconsider Arnett's proposal.
The Marion County Commission also has taken a pass on a previous property tax exemption for senior citizens: an additional $25,000 claim for homesteaded property that was passed in 1998.
The cities of Belleview and McIntosh are the only local governments in Marion to adopt that tax break.
Irvin, a 71-year-old retired life insurance salesman, said in an interview Thursday that he will be back at the next commission meeting to promote it again.
He said he could use the savings to help his wife purchase health insurance, which they cannot afford right now.
"I've been a taxpayer for 40 years, and I could use just a little help in my retirement," Irvin said. "One day they might need a little help themselves."
